    <skos:definition>a technique for identify conceptual X. Users are given a set of topics, and they are asked to rate the similarity of pairs of topics (on some scale, eg 1 to 10). These ratings can them be combined with a statistical technique called cluster analysis to identify groupings of topics that most closely match user ratings. However, the technique doesn't identify the label or meaning of those groups, so the person doing the analysis must interpret the groups and suggest labels if they are needed (or go back to users and ask for candidate labels).This technique can be used, for instance, to discover possible organizations of content for a website. It has the advantage over card sort techniques that the data from each user is somewhat richer (and therefore more informative), but it is generally more time consuming than card sorts.

    <skos:definition>a prototype that only works by having someone behind-the-scenes who is pulling the levers and flipping the switches. The wizard of oz technique in user testing has a user interacting with an interface without knowing that the responses are being generated by a human, not a computer. This allows testing of some difficult interface concepts before a system is fully working.For example, in a search system, a user may type in a query, and an expert behind the scenes rewrites the query in a formal syntax or hand-selects search results. This allows you to test theories in query formulation and filtering of results. Similarly, the wizard of oz technique is popular in testing natural language interfaces where, for instance, the choice of what syntax to support in the system is driven by what syntax users actually use during the tests.

    <skos:definition>baseline is basically where things are in the sense that what we see is what is being done by a majority within a competitive space. Now you could argue that, because most are doing something, more audiences experience the same thing. But that depends on the weight of what we find in the analysis. If we discover that most content is found under similarthe same labels, then user expectations are best served by doing the same -- but this is NOT best practice. This is simply using convention to reduce guesswork.For example, on one project we had used 'Feedback' to label where visitors should contact the client in a number of ways. When given the scenario, You would like to complain to that their navigation sucks, every single user looked for Contact Us. The argument went, doesn't that stifle creativity. Yes and no.

While patterns may change, they don't change as quickly as convention. Vocabulary in the English language is a good example of how quickly conventions change; but best practices for how to communicate really haven't changed a great deal over time. Why. Because we have uncovered patterns (via cognitive psychology, etc.) that people respond to with respect to verbal communication, and we have based our practices accordingly.So, while baseline can get us a certain distance, we transcend baseline by application of best practices in ferreting out user goals and taskdomain expectations.Other definitions of best practice includeA recorded description of process that is recognized by experts as an effective, efficient andor appropriate method for accomplishing a task. Because a best practice is selected from among competing processes that can yield similar results, it is in effect documented wisdom.A method or technique that is recognized by experts as superior to alternatives in its effectiveness and efficiency.

    <skos:definition>a means of expressing that participants in a conversation come with different skills and interests and should have a user-interface that reflects their personal needs.Roles such as chairperson, scribe, and facilitator reflect a set of access capabilities to shared objects in a session. Multiple users can have the same role (eg members of the Red Team) and users can have multiple roles (eg a user can be both a member of the Red Team and a team captain).Roles in society often reflect standard behaviors and tasks, which may not always affect whether people in those roles have access to certain functionality, but may quite often reflect how often they use a certain functionality, and therefore affect how an interface is optimized for each role. Roles may determine how people are involved when playing out a script, such as a restaurant script, where the waiter plays a role which suggests bringing out food and asking if the customer would like dessert, and the customer plays a role which involves sitting down at a table and making choices from a menu.

Many languages are hybrids, part-text and part-visual, and display certain components, such as the user interface, in a visual way while showing the remainder of the program code as text (eg HyperCard and Visual Basic).see also algorithm animationdataflow diagramend-user programminginformation visualizationstate machine diagramcategories &lt;Computer Graphics&gt; &lt;Information Visualization&gt; &lt;Programming Techniques&gt;</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition>the mechanism by which access to a shared object is mediated -- for instance, controlling access to a shared whiteboard (so only one person can draw at a time) or determining who can speak during a chat session (determining who has the floor).Floor control can be applied to any particular access permission of an object, but typically it refers to the right to edit an object while all users are able to view the object. Some examples of floor control are allowing all users to edit the object concurrently, having a moderator who decides who has write permission for the object, or having a token which is passed around to give each user write permission as the token is held.

This passive learner approach is not considered to be most effective.a drill-and-practice system gives the learner exercises to complete, evaluates performance, and presents further exercises to focus on weak areas.a user-modeling approach creates software which analyzes the student's mistakes in solving problems to create instruction which is customized to help the student overcome their misconceptions.an exploratory environment is one in which a learner can construct less-constrained solutions and try out ideas without having a fixed path to knowledge. Simulation systems are common examples.a collaborative learning system focuses on fostering learning through the interaction of multiple students, eg CSCL (computer-supported collaborative learning).

    <skos:prefLabel>interaction design</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the design of how a user communicates, or interacts, with a computer. Interaction designers focus on the flow of interaction, the dialog between person and computer, how input relates to output, stimulus-response compatibility, and feedback mechanisms.This is in contrast to a visual designer, who may be trained in designing visualizations for static media but not necessarily in the dialog which is present in all interactive media. A visual interaction designer is a visual designer with interaction design skills. Interaction design is also in contrast to information architecture - an information architect looks at the organization of information to make the structure of a complex system easy to conceptualize and navigate, but is not usually focused, for instance, on low-level interactions. For example, an information architect may design the structure of an entire website, but not have as much interest in the design of individual pages and how users interact with forms and other controls.

    <skos:definition>quickly generating mockups of what a system will look like. Rapid prototyping may be done with paper prototyping methods, such as with quick sketches, or with techniques like video prototyping or wizard of oz prototyping. Rapid prototyping systems are software systems, such as HyperCard, Director, or RAD tools, that let you quickly display interface elements and define some behavior for them to obtain a sense of the interaction and the capabilities of the fully-implemented system. These prototypes are useful for determining the target of the development project, doing many types of user testing, and spotting unanticipated complexities in the design.

    <skos:definition>an input method commonly used in pen-based systems - or- a physical movement used in communication such as a hand motion or a facial expression.input method - gestures are pen movements that can be recognized as various symbols or commands. For example, a circling movement may indicate selection, a zigzag movement deletion, or a rapid swipe may indicate scrolling.communicative gestures - any body, face, or hand movement which is used in conversation to communicate or to reinforce what is being spoken. Gestures are particularly relevant in synchronous groupware systems such as videoconferencing or shared drawing. Videoconferencing systems, for instance, are often designed to transfer images of the face and miss out on hand gestures. In collaborative applications such as shared drawing, objects can be moved to communicate some physical gestures, and telepointers communicate other gesture information.

    <skos:prefLabel>anecdotal report</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>an example stated in detail to demonstrate a point, often in narrative format. A case study is also a detailed consideration of one example, but in contrast to a case study, an anecdote is often one example selected from many specifically to provide support for a certain point of view.Anecdotes are not generally very useful as evidence to support design decisions because of a number of likely biases involved. For instance, anecdotes frequently represent extreme cases rather than typical cases. Second-hand anecdotes may suffer distortion. Anecdotes are also generally not a very good way to report results because others can't be certain how carefully and responsibly they were selected.Case studies can avoid some of the problems of anecdotal evidence by carefully documenting how specific cases were selected, by establishing careful documentation of how observations are collected and recorded, and by reporting observations in detail, both those that agree with any conclusions drawn and those that disagree.

    <skos:prefLabel>task analysis</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a set of methods for decomposing people's tasks in order to understand the procedures better and to help provide computer support for those tasks. The basic approach is to define the task and the goal of the task and then to list the steps involved. The level of detail in decomposing the steps is determined by how the analysis is going to be used.Task analyses are useful for making time predictions for how long a task will take and for spotting potential errors (steps in the process which are extremely difficult or confusing). Task analyses are also good for spotting areas in a user interface that may have been overlooked or oversimplified. A task analysis is a fundamental part of a cognitive model of user performance, such as GOMS.

Scenarios are often created quite early in a design cycle to help identify requirements and, like task analysis, to identify necessary features that might otherwise have been overlooked.

    <skos:prefLabel>interview</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>gathering information about users by talking directly to them. An interview can typically gather more information than a questionnaire and go into a deeper level of detail. Interviews are good for getting subjective reactions, opinions, and insights into how people reason about issues. Interviews may happen in person or over the phone. Interviewers focus on finding an appropriate sample of interviewees, making the interviewee feel comfortable, and trying to avoid misleading questions or any behavior that might encourage a biased response.Structured interviews are ones with a pre-defined set of questions and responses. They are sometimes better than questionnaires because thorough response is usually easier and because optional avenues of questioning can be explored which depend on answers to earlier questions. A structured approach can provide more reliable, quantifiable data than an open-ended interview, and can be designed rigorously to avoid biases in the line of questioning.Open-ended interviews permit the respondent (interviewee) to provide additional information, ask broad questions without a fixed set of answers, and explore paths of questioning which may occur to the interviewer spontaneously during the interview. An open-ended approach allows for an exploratory approach to uncover unexpected information, used especially when the exact issues of interest haven't been identified yet.Structured and open-ended approaches may be combined. For instance, an interview can begin with structured questions, and once the quantifiable data is covered, open up discussion with the interviewee into other areas.

    <skos:definition>a set of 216 colors which display correctly on 8-bit monitors for both Macintosh and Windows machines. Each platform has an 8-bit color palette of 256 colors, but they only overlap for 216 of those colors. When colors that are not in the web-safe color palette are displayed on 8-bit monitors, they will usually dither, creating a pattern of color which closely approximates the intended color, but doesn't match it exactly.However, with some browsers, a non-web-safe color may be displayed by replacing the color by the closest matching color instead of dithering, or sometimes by displaying a faulty color. Some browsers do not use the standard 8-bit color palette, but instead choose a best-fitting color palette to display all the colors on a web page, which can defeat the use of web-safe colors.The web-safe palette is only important for display on machines that have 8-bit color. The vast majority of machines today have more color, and so are not sensitive to the choice of color palette. Thus, design for this limited palette is not as critical as in the early days of the Web.

Systematic observation attempts to categorize and quantify observations through a structured approach to data collection. Observation offers the opportunity for detailed descriptive analysis of what people do. Observational researchers are often particularly concerned with minimizing observer bias and achieving good inter-observer reliability.Observation is not a particularly good method in general for determining people's opinions and beliefs (instead, use interviews and surveys), and is not particularly strong evidence for determining why something is happening (instead, use an experiment), though in both cases observational studies may provide extremely useful insights.

User testing in clinical settings will often require review by an ethics committee to ensure that patient privacy is not compromised and that no harm will come to patients as a result of testing. As with drug testing, it may not be appropriate to remove a feature from a system for the sake of testing if it appears that the feature is directly benefiting patient care.

    <skos:prefLabel>modal</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a type of interface where the user moves between different states, or modes. In each mode, input from the user is interpreted in a different way. When a user is in a given mode, it's a good idea to provide an extremely salient indicator of which mode is currently active, eg by providing a large icon or shifting the color of the screen.Modes are usually good to avoid because users are restricted in their available actions and they may be confused that the meaning of their actions changes as they change contexts. However, modes can sometimes be helpful to control and guide input (providing security and preventing accidental errors), and modes may be appropriate when they are short and actively maintained by a user (eg the fact that keys refer to capital letters only when the Shift key is held down) and when they follow well-understood conventions, such as painting tools.Examples of modes includeChoosing a painting tool in a paint program. When the Line tool is selected, for instance, all mouse clicks create lines. When a brush tool is selected, the user is in a different mode because all mouse clicks are then interpreted as painting.Old text processors, such as 'vi' in UNIX, often used a command mode and an edit mode. In a command mode, keystrokes issued commands. In an edit mode, keystrokes were entered into a text document.Moving between pages on a website. Each page is a mode which limits the kinds of actions a user can take (where they can go).Modal dialog boxes are ones that force a user to respond to them before the user can go back to using other aspects of the application.

    <skos:definition>a type of interface where the user is free to perform any action in the interface and the interpretation of user input is the same at all times. That is, mouse clicks always have the same effect and keystrokes always have the same effect. This is particularly in contrast to modal interfaces, where the interpretation of input can vary depending on the current state or current settings (the mode).Modeless interfaces are generally preferred to keep a user from getting confused by modes, but in some cases modes may be preferred. For example, a wizard (or assistant) is a structured series of steps that severely restricts a user's actions and can change context with each step, but is helpful to the user by providing guidance and limiting otherwise seemingly infinite parameters to a comprehensible subset.

After doing so, the users may be asked to break groups again into subgroups for large sites. After gathering the groupings from several users, designers can typically spot clear organizations across many users. Statistical analysis can uncover the best groupings from the data where it's not clear by inspection, though inconsistent groupings may be a sign of a poorly-defined goal for the website or a poor choice of web page names.

Exploratory learning does not necessarily mean an unguided or unconstrained learning environment, but does mean that learners may discover unexpected lessons and reach conclusions following various paths.Exploratory learning approaches are considered most appropriate for teaching generalized thinking and problem-solving skills, and may not be the best approach for such things as memorization (though proponents of exploratory learning would emphasize that memorization is probably much less useful than it is often thought to be).Computer support for exploratory learning usually emphasizes using computers as tools rather than as teachers. Not only may traditional software such as spreadsheets be naturally appropriate to the task, but computers also make excellent communication devices for co-discovery and make great simulation devices for exploring safely in otherwise inaccessible domains.

This type of problem is useful for describing problems in coordinating the use of groupware systems.The Prisoner's Dilemma goes like thistwo criminals are arrested for a crime and placed in separate rooms. Each is given the opportunity to confess or remain silent. Each is told the following. If neither of you confess, then a minor penalty will apply to both of you. If you confess and the other prisoner does not, then you will be set free, and he will get a severe punishment. However, if both of you confess, then you will both be charged for the full crime, though some leniency will be shown because of your confession.This challenge is typically represented in a table like the following. The problem is that individually, each prisoner reasons that it is more rational to confess regardless of what the other prisoner does. However, from the point of view of both of them, it would be most rational if neither confessed. Without the opportunity to coordinate their actions, they aren't able to achieve the outcome that is best for the pair of them.Prisoner 1Stay SilentConfessPrisoner 2Stay Silent1 Minor penalty2 Minor penalty1 Set free2 Major penaltyConfess1 Major penalty2 Set free1 Intermediate penalty2 Intermediate penaltyrelated {commons problem} {critical mass} {groupware} categories &lt;Groupware Principles&gt; &lt;Groupware Principles&gt;</skos:definition>

    <skos:prefLabel>artificial intelligence</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>AI; a field of study which examines how to perform high-level thinking on computers. Artificial intelligence research is typically associated with domains such as speech synthesis and recognition, language translation, image recognition, and strategy and planning. AI research is also associated with certain types of algorithms (such as inference engines), data representations (such as blackboards), and general models of thought (such as connectionist networks).Usability issues are critical in many AI systems, where a human works with the system to work out and apply results (as in language translation systems and expert systems), and when the AI system serves as the user interface for the user (as with speech systems). AI also is applied in some systems to build a computer model of the user, which is then used to help anticipate the user's needs and optimize the interface (as in computer-aided instruction systems and adaptive systems).AI is part of the field of cognitive science. Approaches to AI typically seek to build systems that can act intelligently in one way or another, often taking approaches modeled on human cognition, but not constrained to a human model. This contrasts with the field of cognitive psychology, which seeks to create computational models of human cognition specifically to build a more complete understanding of human cognition.The term artificial intelligence is misleading to the extent that, to begin with, we really don't have a good grasp of what intelligence is. Human intelligence is often considered to be characterized by those properties of thought that are not demonstrated by other animals, such as language, long-term planning, symbolic manipulation, reasoning, and meta-cognition. However, arithmetic, for example, which is unique to humans, is nevertheless not considered to be the proper domain of artificial intelligence.The most common criterion considered for evaluating whether a computer has achieved human intelligence is the Turing test. In the Turing test, a person communicates via a text terminal with two hidden conversational partners another human and a computer. If the person cannot distinguish between the human and the computer, then the computer would be considered to be behaving intelligently. However, numerous problems with this definition of intelligence exist. For example, in practice, when this test is applied, humans are often mistaken for computers, indicating that we don't really have a good sense of what we mean by considering a human to be intelligent in the first place !related {CAI} {cognitive modeling} {cognitive psychology} {intelligent tutoring system} {natural language interface} {OCR} {speech-to-text system} categories &lt;Acronyms&gt; &lt;Fields of Study&gt; &lt;Cognitive Modeling&gt; &lt;Cognitive Modeling&gt;</skos:definition>

Source code control systems are an example of asynchronous groupware systems.Each person who wishes to modify source code checks out the code, which notifies others who wish to access that code that it is currently being modified. Once the change is made, it is checked in. Versions are tracked so that it is possible to revert to previous versions of a document. The system also conveniently handles large sets of documents and frequently handles contingencies between them. Some systems include the ability for multiple people to modify the same document at the same time (but independently) and then to resolve differences once the documents are merged.

    <skos:prefLabel>anonymity</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the ability to participate in interactions with other people without being identified. Anonymity can be at various levels, including hiding a person's name and other characteristics, such as age and gender; from simply making their name accessible but nonobvious, to helping to make sure that the person is entirely untraceable, and that no identifying information about them is ever available.Anonymity can be useful for protecting people's privacy and security. Anonymity can also help people participate in conversations without fear of reprisal (helping to encourage open and honest discussions) and with less concern for being stereotyped based on their identity or characteristics.Anonymity creates potentials for abuse. While on the one hand, it can protect people from targeted harassment, it can also protect people who harass from being identified. It can create security problems, and is inappropriate for certain security situations. It also causes problems in situations where someone needs to take responsibility and be held accountable, as in cases where people's safety is involved.

    <skos:prefLabel>privacy</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the principle of protecting private information about people, especially in shared or collaborative systems, and of helping to keep people free of distractions. Privacy may be provided for security reasons, to keep people (such as celebrities) from being deluged with people contacting them, or to simply allow people to protect personal information from being shared with others (for whatever reason).In many systems, privacy is in tension with a legitimate desire to share information to help people coordinate (as in 'awareness' systems). Ethical concerns need to guide how we decide what information to make available and how. One example is the principle of reciprocity, which says that people can not find information about you without making the same information about themselves available to you. Of course, the principle of reciprocity alone is not sufficient. Another concern is that people sometimes need to share certain information about themselves for reasons of security or accountability.

    <skos:definition>a family of methods for evaluating a user interface by collecting data from people actually using the system.A simple user test would be to bring in a small number of potential users of the software (perhaps 8 to 10) and have each person sit down and use the software to perform a series of tasks while an observer takes notes about what difficulties each user encounters. Typically, users are asked to think out loud while they work with the software to help the observers understand how the users think about their problems and how the interface could be improved.More involved user testing may test more users, get as representative a selection of users as possible, try out a variety of tasks, control the testing environment in various ways (or test a more naturalistic work environment), use more careful or thorough measurement instruments (videotaping, recording keystrokes, etc.), or combine the testing with other methods of data collection, such as interviews of users.

Deeper criticisms are often meant to be part of a long-term dialogue with society about the various impacts of our design decisions. Practical critiques are often intended simply for quickly improving our design of software and improving our purchasing decisions, based on the practical expertise of the critic, and in a more cost-effective fashion than most formal evaluation methods.

    <skos:prefLabel>intrusiveness</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the property of a perceptual signal that enables it to draw attention from other activities. Perceptually, a sound or a bright flash can draw attention from people even when they are attending to something else. This property is useful for such applications as emergency warnings or to attract people to events of high importance or short duration. For instance, a ringing phone draws someone's attention so that they'll pick up the line before the caller hangs up.On the other hand, in many situations intrusive signals can interfere with a higher-priority primary task. In those situations, most people want to turn off intrusive signals that don't indicate emergencies, for instance, by turning off their phone ringer.Paying attention to which types of signals can be intrusive (audio, flickering media, speech, animations, large changes in the visual field, touching), we can help the user control when and how they wish to be interrupted and avoid distracting them with unnecessary signals.In the non-perceptual domain, many interruptions of work, such as spam email, are viewed as intrusive, to the extent that people cannot avoid the way in which those activities interfere with their desired activities.

This is important when deleting files, writing over files (eg saving over an old version), or whenever data will be permanently lost. This principle is often violated in database systems, where, for the sake of efficiency, data is overwritten as soon as a user moves to a new record, even without explicitly acknowledging that the previous data should be lost. The principle of explicit destruction is related to the forgiveness principle, which suggests minimizing irreversible operations so that users can explore without fear of destroying any information.

    <skos:prefLabel>desktop metaphor</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the representation of familiar desktop items in a user interface to help make the capabilities of a computer clear. The prototypical example is the Macintosh desktop which is used as a backdrop for all application windows and the surface on which files are manipulated. Files are organized into folders, and other objects including disks and printers, appear as icons on the background desktop. Traditionally, the Mac included desk accessories, including a calculator, notepad, scrapbook, and clock, that correspond to items a person might have on their desk. This organizing metaphor presumably makes new users more comfortable with the system and helps them to learn more quickly how to interact with it.

    <skos:prefLabel>speed-accuracy tradeoff</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>in many types of perceptual-motor tasks, there is a tradeoff between how fast a task can be performed and how many mistakes are made in performing the task. That is, a user can either perform the task very fast with a large number of errors or very slow with very few errors. When asked to perform a task as well as possible, people will apply various strategies that may optimize speed, optimize accuracy, or combine the two. For this reason, comparing the performance of 2 users cannot be done on the basis of speed or accuracy alone, but both values need to be known.Under some testing situations, people can be instructed to optimize either speed or accuracy, and they will effectively adopt the appropriate strategy. However, results can be extremely hard to compare, because time differences between a person who made zero errors and a person who made one error can be dramatic. For this reason, in situations where a speed-accuracy tradeoff exists, the relationship between speed and accuracy needs to be mapped out.

For instance, some types of standards inspections can be performed automatically, as in an HTML-checking tool that tests for cross-platform compatibility or a dialog-layout tool that verifies spacing and alignment properties. A computer can also simulate human interaction sequences (mouse clicks, text entry) to test a product's robustness. By supplying the computer with a user model, such as a set of goals, tasks, and ways to perform those tasks, a system can be profiled for completeness and to detect likely sources of user confusion.Other forms of automatic evaluation include using logging tools to capture user interaction data and using online feedback forms to capture user impressions and automatically provide summaries of those responses.

    <skos:prefLabel>cascading stylesheets</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>CSS; a method for specifying the look of a web page independent of the markup of the structure of that page.The original intent in HTML markup was to specify the structure of a page and allow the individual user to determine how that structure should be displayed. Thus, marking something with the H1 tag indicated it was a header, but would not specifically indicated how headers are formatted, ie at a certain font size, spacing, and indentation. This approach worked fairly well in the early days of the web while the users were researchers sharing information about their organizations and research with each other. This approach also works fairly well for making web pages accessible to those who have visual impairments because a browser can be created to present the same information in a non-visual mode.However, the web quickly became a commercial tool, and was soon used for marketing, entertainment, and challenging communication tasks that required significantly more control over the format of the presentation. The initial temptation was to skip the use of semantic tags like H1 that only indicate the meaning of what they tag and instead use formatting tags like B (bold) and font (for choosing a font) to get the exact effect required. Because this would mean losing the semantic information in the document, users have less control, the document becomes less accessible to the disabled, and automatic processing of documents by computer programs becomes more difficult.As a result, cascading style sheets were created. They allow the HTML programmer to specify that semantic tags like H1 have a preferred appearance (font, size, color, spacing, etc.). They also allow multiple documents to share appearance specifications, permitting the change of appearances to be much simpler.

When a line is drawn on a computer screen, the common way to draw it in the early days was with black and white pixels on a grid -- the line thus had jagged edges. Antialiasing is a method for drawing the line using intermediate gray pixels to smooth it out. Antialiasing can be used for any graphic shape and is used to render letters also (sometimes called font smoothing).Unsmoothed, or aliased, images have sharp corners called jaggies.

    <skos:definition>a software feature that saves the file periodically while the user works on a document. Usually a user would need to explicitly save a file and risk forgetting to. The user would lose data if the application fails (eg during a power outage) and the user hasn't saved. Autosave has the risk on the other hand, of overwriting previous versions of a file and preventing a user from reverting without saving changes. For this reason, the autosave feature often allows backups to be made automatically, may query the user before each save, and can allow a schedule to be determined for when it saves.Another model for saving data is common in database systems -- persistence.

However, individuals have the incentive to graze as many cattle as possible on the Commons as opposed to their on private property. If too many people send too many cattle to the Commons, the Commons is destroyed, and the whole village is worse off as a result. There are a couple straightforward solutions to the Commons problem an appropriate fee can be charged for each head of cattle or a limit can be imposed to the number of cattle any individual may bring.

    <skos:definition>abstraction-link-view architecture. A technique for building software by developing the application as a user interface (the View), the abstract data and semantics (the Abstraction), and a set of relationships between these parts (the Links).This technique makes it easy to add many different types of views onto one abstraction, useful in particular for the construction of multi-user interfaces, but also useful for building debugging systems and for software engineering in general enabling user interfaces and underlying applications to be developed relatively independently.The ALV architecture is similar in spirit to model-view-controller (MVC). ALV differs from MVC in 2 primary waysALV is based on a constraint system to manage consistency between the abstraction and view. The links are a special kind of constraint that can create and destroy objects as well as maintain relationships between their values.ALV combines input and output in the view, whereas MVC separates input and output in the view and controller. constraint UIMScategories &lt;Acronyms&gt; &lt;Software Architectures&gt;</skos:definition>

In conventional videoconferencing systems, the camera is spatially offset from the monitor for viewing other people, and thus, when directly looking at another person, it appears that you are looking slightly away from them. It's not clear how this may affect communication, because in most cases the conversational partner may be perfectly aware of the phenomenon and able to determine whether they are being looked at or not even without perfect eye contact.

    <skos:prefLabel>speech impairment</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>difficulty in spoken language, whether through vocalization or articulation impairments or through neurological language disorders. Computers can facilitate communication for people with speech difficulties. The field of study examining this is called AAC -- Augmentative and Alternative Communication.Aphasias (language disorders) may be aided in a variety of ways depending on the nature of the disorder. In extreme cases, a person with an aphasia may find it impossible to communicate sentences in any amount of time or in any medium, and in those cases, choice systems may help them communicate a limited set of ideas without syntax.When motor impairments are the source of speech difficulties, assistive devices allow a person to use non-vocal means to specify a phrase and may provide speech synthesis as output. Keyboards may be sufficient devices for some, but when motor impairment is more broad, some people may be able to enter single keystrokes only very slowly. A chart-retrieval system allows a person to enter an entire message by selecting it from a set of choices presented in a chart. Letter and message prediction systems anticipate the most likely next letter, word, or phrase that someone will wish to enter and make those easier to access.

    <skos:prefLabel>constraint</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a declarative specification of relationships between variables. These relationships are automatically maintained by the system. Among other applications, constraints are used in graphics systems to specify layout, eg by specifying that two objects should always be connected with a line or aligned along the same axis.A one-way constraint maintenance system allows the specification of relationships between variables, such that a variable B can be triggered to update whenever a variable A updates, but a relationship from B to A cannot exist. That is, cycles are not allowed. A one-way constraint maintenance system is not significantly different from an active value system, except perhaps syntactically.A two-way constraint maintenance system allows cycles and prevents them from infinitely cycling by either stopping after one pass through the cycle, waiting for the system to settle to a stable state (ending propagation when a value does not change more than a given threshold), or through slightly more sophisticated techniques.A constraint solver does not propagate changes, but instead solves for the next state of the entire system by solving systems of equations. Constraint solvers are limited to mathematical systems that are well enough understood to be easily solved, ie linear equations.

    <skos:prefLabel>active value</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a programming language extension that allows functions to be called every time a variable (the active value) is changed.Along with callbacks and constraint systems, active values belong to a family of techniques that are extremely helpful in programming user interfaces to maintain consistency between data and their graphical representation.Unlike callbacks, active values are a mechanism integrated into the programming language, so that programming using active values has simpler syntax and does not require explicit maintenance of the list of functions triggered. Unlike constraint systems, the triggering of an active value will always call the associated functions and won't resolve cycles. For instance, if a function associated with variable A changes the value of variable B, and a function associated with B changes the value of A, then the active value system will cycle forever (unless the program includes explicit checks for cycles).

    <skos:prefLabel>cut and paste</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a simple device for users to move itemsdata into different parts of a document and between different documents and applications. A user selects an object and selects the cut command (from a menu or toolbar). This removes the object from its current position and places it into the system clipboard. (Alternatively, a user can copy the item to put it on the clipboard without removing it from its current location.) Then a user selects the destination for the item, chooses the paste command and the item is copied from the system clipboard to the new location (note that the clipboard still contains a version of the object).Some variations on cut and paste includeDrag and Drop an alternative to cut and paste that allows a user to directly manipulate the object to move it from one place to another. Drag and drop is more intuitive because it doesn't involve the intermediate abstraction of a clipboard. However, drag and drop is inconvenient when the source and destination of the object can't easily be on the screen at the same time.Paste Swap allows the item on the clipboard to be swapped with the currently-selected item, which is dramatically more convenient for situations in which two items need to be swapped with each other. With cut and paste, a temporary space must be used to store one of the items.Paste Format allows the format of one item to be applied to another without replacing the item.View Clipboard allows users to visually see what items are currently on the clipboard.

This is a simpler approach to upgrading a legacy system than reimplementing it, but has the obvious limitation of not providing an interaction style that is tuned to take advantage of the GUI.Screen-scraping may sometimes refer to the casual substitution of one design style for another without rewriting the application.In the context of groupware, screen-scraping refers to sending out the screen of one user to others without customizing the output for each user. This allows multiple users to share information for collaboration, but without much control. Input in such systems is handled by sending in input from whichever user has control at any given time, or by combining inputs.

    <skos:prefLabel>role-playing walkthrough</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a method for evaluating a user interface, particularly one where multiple people may be interacting during its use, such as customer service applications (cash registers, telemarketing) and groupware. Each person in the evaluation team acts the part of a user or other person involved in a dialog with the user, and they step through primary tasks for which the user interface is intended. As with other walkthrough techniques, the goal is to identify difficulties with the tasks and ways to improve the interface, and the evaluation team ideally consists of a variety of stakeholders in the design (designers, programmers, users, etc).

    <skos:prefLabel>stimulus-response compatibility</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the degree to which what people perceive is consistent with the actions they need to take.Saying red when you see a red light go on is an example of high compatibility. Having to say green when a red light goes on is an example of low compatibility.Common examples in user interfaces arein ordered lists (such as email ordered by date), the lists may be listed from top to bottom, but the Next arrow may be pointing to the right. If you click on the right arrow, do you select the item above the current item or below it. This can be especially confusing if the items are ordered with the most recent email (the last one) at the top. A more compatible arrangement would be to have up and down arrows, which always move the selection up or down, regardless of the order of the list.when a range of cells is selected in a spreadsheet, clicking on the down arrow at the bottom of a row will take you to the top of the next row. Sometime this is what people have intended. Sometimes not. Related {affordance} categories &lt;Psychological Principles&gt; &lt;Psychological Principles&gt;</skos:definition>

This support is often available through a hot line, bulletin board, or mailing list. Customer support can be a significant cost to the software manufacturer that is significantly affected by the usability of the product.Customer support is help provided to a customer (a user) to help resolve difficulties in using a system, usually in the form of a human answering questions over the phone. Customer support personnel can provide substantially more relevant and useful help to a user than a help system can, but a common problem is being confused about the state of the computer the user is using, so various ways to communicate the current system state and error codes to customer support help them to isolate problems.Improving the usability of an application will usually reduce the use of customer support and thus save customer support costs (except where customer support is a profit center, in which case, the incentive is to decrease usability, but this is obviously a nasty cycle you don  t want to get into).Some customer support can be provided automatically to reduce costs, such as including help within the application, providing support information on your website, or using automated telephone-answering systems and fax-back services to provide relevant help.

    <skos:definition>the first mass-market computer with a graphical user interface, the Macintosh was introduced in 1984. Its operating system is known as Mac OS. Many of the original concepts behind its user interface were adapted from work done at Xerox on the Alto and Star machines and SmallTalk and first incorporated in Apple's Lisa a few years before the Mac. The 1984 Macintosh was tremendously innovative in its industrial design, its establishment of user interface standards to apply broadly across applications, and its refinement of user interface widgets into extremely easy-to-use components.

For instance, if I add a certain button to my word processor, will people be able to write their documents faster. In this example you would have an experimental condition, using the word processor with the button added, and a control condition, using the word processor without the button. The independent variable is the factor you are manipulating, whether or not the button is present.

    <skos:definition>(programming) a version of object-oriented programming that does not have classes. Instead, objects inherit behavior directly from other objects. This dramatically simplifies the language by removing unnecessary concepts such as metaclasses. This approach was popularized by the Self language.(psychology) a theory of how people organize concepts. A concept is assumed to be defined by a prototype, so that, when a person thinks of birds in general, a prototypical bird comes to mind, let's say a sparrow. Then when deciding whether anything else is a bird, they compare how similar it is to their prototype. Thus, an ostrich still seems like a bird, but much less like a bird than a robin, which is very similar to a sparrow.

    <skos:definition>a traditional linear model of the software development process that suggests each phase of development could be completed independently and pass its results onto the next phase. Thus, a requirements phase would produce a requirements document that would then be used as input to a system architecture phase. This traditional approach has been widely criticized and various approaches stressing a more iterative development process have been preferred. The central problem is the need for feedback from later stages in development to inform earlier stages, such as the requirements phase. This is often achieved through successively refining prototypes toward the final system and updating the requirements and design as a better understanding is developed.

Worker productivity is measured by how much one person can do in one month. Thus, what takes 1 person 100 months to perform should take 100 people 1 month to perform.This perspective is called mythical because it doesn't apply in many organizational settings, and in particular in software development environments.

    <skos:definition>A user interface based on a user editing individual lines of text at a time, especially with regard to early text editors. In such systems, instead of moving around in the document as in screen-oriented editors or graphical user interfaces, the user could enter commands to list out lines within a document or could specify a line to edit. The user could edit an individual line by inserting and removing characters and moving the cursor left and right. While this level of interaction seems quite primitive, it was largely dictated by the constraints of the technology (some line editors used line printers as the output device, rather than CRTs) and by the speed of interaction with shared computers.

    <skos:prefLabel>multi-dimensional scaling</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>MDS; a statistical technique useful for understanding the structure of a domain, especially useful in early stages of design. People are asked to rate pairs of concepts for their similarity, then these similarities are fed into the statistical algorithm to determine dimensions that effectively describe these patterns of similarities. Essentially, the idea is to determine a space in which each concept can be mapped so that similar items are close and dissimilar items are far away. The MDS algorithm seeks to find the fewest dimension in which such a space is possible.As an example, consider an application for choosing baby names where you want people to be able to find an appropriate name as quickly as possible. You would ask potential users (expecting parents, for instance) to rate the similarities of large numbers of names, eg On a scale of 1 (very similar) to 7 (very dissimilar), how would you rate the names John and Sarah. After getting a large number of ratings, the MDS algorithm would then determine the dimensions that best describe the data. The algorithm won't name those dimensions for you, but will simply specify a number of dimensions and where each name falls along each dimension. So for instance, you may find a dimension in which Joe, Bob, and Tom all fall at one end while Jenny, Amy, and Susan all fall at the other end. In this case, you would be likely to identify the dimension as gender. In the example of names, you might also find dimensions of nationality and pronunciation. Thus, your interface for selecting names may allow the users to select gender, nationality, and sounds to help them find an appropriate name, or you may allow the user to ask for similar names once they have found one they basically like.

    <skos:definition>a user interface that allows people to interact using a human language, such as English, as opposed to a computer language, command line interface, or graphical user interface. Natural language interfaces may be designed for understanding either written or spoken text. Typical approaches have been attempting to replace command lines and database queries with natural language queries or trying to use natural language syntax for programming languages (eg two simple attempts were Cobol and HyperTalk).The most common problem is ambiguity -- users actually frequently prefer the consistency and clarity of computer languages to the unpredictable results of a natural language command, which may have multiple interpretations. The other fundamental problem with achieving full natural language understanding is that understanding language often means being able to reason as a human being would reason and having available the full knowledge of a human being, and this problem has proven to be at a level of complexity still far beyond the scope of current technology.

Vertical scrollbars (shown below) move the data up and down, and horizontal scrollbars move the data left and right within the view.Scroll arrows cause the view to be shifted incrementally in one direction at a time. A scrollbox (also called a thumb or elevator) allows the user to move to a specific region.

Instead, it typically just displays a large and stunning graphic or a simple typographic message to intrigue the viewer and lure them into the website.In practice, it's rarely a good idea, since it wastes precious download time for the user, it obscures by not including critical information about the website, and it delays the time that a person actually enters and starts using the website, increasing the probability that you've exceeded the user's patience or attention span and they've left for another site before they even figured out what yours was. Splash pages open up numerous opportunities for poor design such that users can't find their way into a website.Frequent problems includenot including clear navigation or a clear means of entering into the website - many users will not discover that they can click on the image to enter if the image doesn't clearly say so.providing no clear options to users who do not load images.requiring the use of plug-ins or browser features that are not backward-compatible, so that many users are excluded because of the capabilities of their machines or the type of browser they've chosen to use.

    <skos:prefLabel>virtual value chain analysis</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>a virtual value chain is a business model for the information services industry, developed by John Sviokla. The value chain starts with the Content provider, then goes to the Information Infrastructure for distribution and transactional support, and then to the Context provider supplying user interfaces and customer interactions (Content-Infrastructure-Context-Customer). It contrasts with a physical value chain of manufacturing-distribution-sales for traditional product companies.An analysis of the virtual value chain examines what role a particular company plays within this chain, and if they are not currently providing information-based (eg internet-based) services, how they can transition to the information-based business model. Really, the virtual value chain merely provides a conceptual framework in which you'll do a more traditional business-process-reengineering (BPR) analysis.

A typical way to specify the necessary elements is to supply a screen layout with each item labeled (the screen layout doesn  t have to be final, but merely indicative of the content elements and the constraints on them, such as size and relationship to other elements). The list of pages usually comes directly from a site architecture. This, in combination with a style guide (specifying the look of graphic elements, such as fonts and colors, and the writing style), provides the primary information needed by content developers.

    <skos:prefLabel>kerning</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the amount of spacing between adjacent letters of type. It's not sufficient to have letters equally spaced in order for them to look equally spaced. In a word like balloon, the letter pair ll must be further apart than the letter pair oo in order to appear evenly spaced. Letters should be adjusted by a principle of optical spacing, looking at how much whitespace is created between each letter pair and adjusting to make that amount of whitespace even throughout a word.Most computer fonts have built-in kerning rules so that kerning rarely needs to be done by hand, but it may still be necessary for small fonts, unusually wide or tight spacing, or for logos and headlines where minor spacing problems will be more apparent. In very tight spacing, some letters may overlap, and this may require adjusting the individual letterforms to create a desirable appearance. Sometimes a principle called TNT, tight-no-touching, is used when tightening up words to move letters as close as possible without letters touching, but this will often result in poor optical spacing.

Algorithms rely on frequency of keywords, order, prominence, expert indexing, and popularity of a result for a given keyword. Advanced search engines often consider these types of capabilities -- spell-checking, synonym substitution (if they look for 'jobs' they might also want 'careers'), stop words (the term 'web' doesn't usefully distinguish web pages, so ignore it), fuzzy queries (allow non-exact matches), and stem words (if they asked for 'biking' also look for 'bike').displaying resultssome issues in displaying results include how to rank results, how to group results (by category, domain name, etc.) and visualize relationships between them, how to display results within a structured document, what information to show about each match, and how many matches to display.

    <skos:prefLabel>noun-verb paradigm</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>an approach to specifying commands to the computer, also called the select-then-operate paradigm. First an object or objects (representing some data -- the nouns) are selected. Then an operation (or commands -- the verb) is selected to perform some action on the objects.The alternative, the verb-noun paradigm, is the approach taken most often by command-line systems. The verb-noun approach corresponds to English commands Delete this file. It also better supports multiple arguments to the command.The common rationale for noun-verb interaction is that it removes modes -- if you select an object, you can easily deselect, change, or extend the selection, whereas with verb-noun, you choose a verb and the system is left stuck waiting for a noun, in a mode. Of course, this is ridiculous since the verb can obviously be changed or deselected just like a noun and the modality problem can occur in both directions.In the end, noun-verb dialogues are more appropriate when many operations are needed for a single object , and verb-noun dialogues are best when multiple objects need a similar operation performed.

    <skos:prefLabel>internal validity</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition>the degree to which the design of a study allows you to accurately attribute an observation to a specific cause rather than alternative causes. An undesirable alternative cause for your result is known as a confound.An example is to compare the amount of time it takes in using 2 alternative interface designs. You would like to claim that if one design is faster than another, then the time difference is due solely to differences in the interfaces. An example of a confound is when different groups of people are tested for each design-- if one group is more skilled than another, that would be an alternative explanation for the observed time difference.A control variable is a potential confound that has been controlled for so that it can reasonably be ruled out as a possible explanation. For instance, to avoid the above confound, subjects can be a control variable by assigning them randomly to each test condition.

    <skos:definition>the degree to which an observed result, such as a difference between 2 measurements, can be relied upon and not attributed to random error in sampling and measurement.The degree of statistical significance of a result depends upon the number of sampled data points (eg the number of users in a test), the size of the effect, and the amount of variation between measurements. Thus, statistical validity can be improved with increased samples, by reducing noise (and thus variation), and by creating as large an effect as possible.
