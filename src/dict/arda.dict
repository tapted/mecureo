Ad&#251;naic
	[adunaic.txt]
	The Mannish tongue of the N&#250;men&#243;reans
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	First called Ad&#251;naic in the early Second Age.There is no record of its use after the Downfall in II 33191
	Persisted in common use for some 3,300 years
	Origins:
	Evolved from the old tongue used by the Men of the House of Hador
	Race:
	Men
	Division:
	N&#250;men&#243;reans
	Pronunciation:
	Uncertain2
	Meaning:
	'(Language of the) West'
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	N&#250;men&#243;rean
	The native tongue of the N&#250;men&#243;reans, the ancestral language of Westron.
	Notes
	1
	Though the name Ad&#251;naic cannot have been used before the Edain travelled to N&#250;menor at the beginning of the Second Age, the language itself, or something very close to it, seems to have been spoken in Beleriand during the First Age, at least by the people of the House of Hador.  While there is no mention of its use after the Downfall, it cannot have become completely extinct at this date; it seems likely that the scholars of Gondor and of Arnor would have been familiar with the ancient tongue of their ancestors, but in general use Ad&#251;naic was replaced by the Westron (which had developed from it) and Elvish languages.
	2
	Following the conventions of Elvish pronunciation, the word would be pronounced a'doon-ike. Ad&#251;naic is not an Elvish word, though, and is in fact so clearly modelled on real linguistic terms such as Hebraic or Aramaic that a pronunciation based on these, a'doon-ayik, seems somewhat more plausible.

Aiglos (Aeglos)
	[aeglos.txt]
	The Spear of Gil-galad
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Used in the Battle of Dagorlad in II 34341
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Noldor
	Family:
	House of Fingolfin
	Pronunciation:
	eye'glos ('eye' represents the pronunciation of that English word, with the same pronunciation holding for either alternative spelling)
	Meaning:
	'Snow-point'2
	Other&nbsp;names:
	Spear of Gil-galad
	Note:
	There are two variant spellings of this spear's name, Aiglos and Aeglos (though in fact these are pronounced in the same way, and would be written identically in Elvish characters).  Aeglos is the most common form, but Aiglos is the spelling used (just once) in The Lord of the Rings, and is thus - arguably - preferable from a canonical point of view.
	The spear of Gil-galad, carried by him to the War of the Last Alliance.  Its name is translated 'snow-point'.
	Notes
	1
	The spear must surely have been in Gil-galad's possession for some time before the Battle of Dagorlad, and may well have dated back to the First Age or even before.  Nevertheless, the Battle is the only situation where the spear explicitly appears.
	2
	'Snow-point' is the literal interpretation of the spear's name, but some sources go further and suggest the broader meaning 'icicle'.  This might easily be correct, but to complicate matters there's an alternative in the name of a plant that grew in Beleriand, known as aeglos (a name interpreted as 'Snowthorn').  It's possible, then, that the point of Gil-galad's spear represented a thorn of this plant, rather than an icicle.

Aeglos
	[aeglosplant.txt]
	The snowthorn of Amon R&#251;dh
	A tall, thorny plant, apparently related to modern gorse, but somewhat larger than that plant.  Its sweet-smelling flowers were white, and from them it took its name: aeglos is Elvish for 'snowthorn'.  It was found on the slopes of Amon R&#251;dh in West Beleriand and surely elsewhere, but if it ever grew east of the Blue Mountains, it is no longer found today.  Aeglos shares its name with the famous Spear of Gil-galad, but it isn't clear whether the two names are directly connected with one another.

	The trackless fens of Aelin-uial
	The maze of lakes and fens formed where the River Aros met the Sirion, before it fell beneath the Andram.  These were lands heavy with enchantment, both from the Girdle of Melian guarding Doriath to the north, but also from the power of Ulmo that was strong in Sirion's waters.  It was here that Turgon and Finrod were given the idea of building their hidden strongholds at Gondolin and Nargothrond; an idea placed in their dreams by Ulmo.The Aelin-uial was under the control of the Sindarin Kingdom of Doriath.  Thingol's marchwardens maintained secret ferries among the reeds, so that they could cross between Sirion's easten and western banks unregarded, if need be.At the southern end of the Aelin-uial, Sirion's waters collected together once more from the many paths they took through the marshland and, at the place called the Falls of Sirion, fell in a thundering torrent down into the earth.

	Note:
	'Ainur' is a plural term; the singular form is 'Ainu'.
	&quot;There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Il&#250;vatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought...&quot;
	First words of the Ainulindal&#235;
	The primordial spirits, who existed with Il&#250;vatar, and with Him created the world through the Music of the Ainur.  After the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide and order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the rest.  Fourteen of these great Ainur became the Valar, or Powers of Arda.  The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became the first Dark Lord.  The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar into Arda are known as Maiar.Origins of the AinurThe Ainur were the first, and mightiest, beings created by Il&#250;vatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World.  The Ainur were the 'offspring of [Il&#250;vatar's] thought', and each was given understanding only of that part of the mind of Il&#250;vatar from which he or she came.  The exception to this was Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur, who had a part of the gifts of all the others.The Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken to mean that they were granted free will by their creator.  Il&#250;vatar instructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to make the Music of the Ainur; the great song that created the Vision of Il&#250;vatar and ultimately the real World.The Ainur and the WorldThrough the Music of the Ainur, Il&#250;vatar created a Vision of the World; he showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny to them - so the Ainur have much knowledge of the World, but are not omniscient.  Then, Il&#250;vatar granted the World true being.  Melkor and many of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the Children of Il&#250;vatar (that is, Elves and Men). These became the beings known as the Valar and the Maiar.Those Ainur who entered the World at its beginning remain bound to it until its end.  Though Melkor was eventually thrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before the end.  Little is known of the ultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that, after the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second, even greater, Music with the Children of Il&#250;vatar.The Line of MelianAmong the many Ainur that entered the World long ago, there was one of the order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded one of the Children of Il&#250;vatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath.  From her, a strain of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and Men, passed down through generation after generation, and was still present at the time of the War of the Ring.  Elrond was Melian's great-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though through many more generations than Elrond.

Alatar
	[alatar.txt]
	One of the lost Blue Wizards
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Immortal.  Arrived in Middle-earth c. III 1000
	Race:
	Ainur
	Division:
	Maiar of Orom&#235;
	Order:
	Istari (Wizards)
	Meaning:
	Unknown1
	One of the five Wizards who came to the northwest of Middle-earth in the Third Age; he journeyed into the east with Pallando, and never returned to the western lands.Alatar was one of the original three2 Wizards selected by the Valar for the journey from Valinor to Middle-earth (the other two being Curumo and Ol&#243;rin - Saruman and Gandalf).Alatar and Pallando arrived in Middle-earth dressed in sea-blue.  For this reason, they were together given the name Ithryn Luin, the Blue Wizards.  With Saruman, they journeyed into the far east of Middle-earth, but while Saruman returned to the west, Alatar and Pallando did not.  Of their fate, we know almost nothing3.
	Notes
	1
	The name Alatar can be interpreted (somewhat awkwardly) as 'after-comer'.  If this is correct, it must be a reference to his being selected as the second Wizard, after Curumo (Saruman).  It might equally have been given to him after his arrival in Middle-earth (he arrived after Saruman), but Tolkien specifically states that neither Alatar nor Pallando had a name in the known regions of Middle-earth - in this case, Alatar must be viewed not so much as a name, but rather as a simple description.A curious, and probably spurious, alternative meaning is &#225;lat ar, 'noble giant'.
	2
	The Valar originally intended to send just three Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth.  Aiwendil (Radagast) was added to this number by Yavanna, and Pallando was taken by Alatar 'as a friend'.
	3
	Tolkien tells us 'What success they [Alatar and Pallando] had I do not know; but I fear they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were the founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No. 211).

	&nbsp;&#149; The Old
	The second son of King Brego of Rohan.  His elder brother Baldor had been lost while attempting to pass the Paths of the Dead, and so Aldor succeeded his father to become the third King of Rohan.  He was just twenty-six years old when he came to the throne, and his reign of seventy-five years was the longest in the annals of the Mark.  On account of his great age - he reached his one hundred and second year before he died - he is often referred to as Aldor the Old.Aldor was the founder of a golden age in Rohan's history.  In his time, the Rohirrim increased greatly in numbers, and he succeeded in driving all the Dunlendings from his realm.  Aldor had many children, of which the three eldest were daughters.  It was his fourth child, Fr&#233;a, who succeeded him as King, but due to Aldor's long life, Fr&#233;a had to wait until he was himself seventy-five years old before he became Lord of the Mark.

	&nbsp;&#149; Uilos
	An Elvish name meaning 'immortal', it was one of the their names for the flower Men called simbelmyn&#235; (they also used the name uilos for the same flower).  The name comes from its habit of growing thickly on the tombs of Men: it was found among the Kings' mounds of Rohan, and also on the Tomb of Elendil.  The flower is described as being bell-like in shape, and could appear in many soft shades, though white seems to have been the most common.
	In his comments in Unfinished Tales, Christopher Tolkien points out that Legolas' description of 'golden bells ... of mallos and alfirin', quoted above, isn't quite in harmony with other descriptions, and he suggests that this particular use of the name may refer to a different flower altogether.  Alternatively, the golden flowers of Lebennin might simply be a differently-coloured variety of the white alfirin commonly seen on Men's tombs.

Almaren
	[almaren.txt]
	The ancient home of the Valar
	Dates:
	Many, many millennia ago, even predating the Years of the Trees
	Location:
	The Great Lake in the central regions of Middle-earth
	Origins:
	Founded by the Valar
	Race:
	Valar
	Pronunciation:
	a'lmahren
	Meaning:
	'Blessed (place)'1
	Before the time of the Two Trees of Valinor, and even before the Valar came to Valinor, they dwelt on the green island of Almaren in the Great Lake.  In the mists of time, long before the awakening of Elves or Men, the Valar dwelt east of the Sea in Middle-earth.  This was a time called the Spring of Arda, when the Earth was lit by the two Lamps of the Valar, and Almaren lay in the central regions of the World, where the light of the two Lamps mingled.Of the details of Almaren we know little - there was green grass on the island, and the Valar had a 'dwelling' there, which presumably constituted a city, or at least a town.  In the history of the Valar, Almaren was known as the place where Tulkas wed Nessa.Of much greater importance, though, is the fact that Almaren was the site of the Valar's first major defeat at the hands of Melkor: he loosed his forces secretly from his northern fortress of Utumno (then newly delved).  Both the Lamps of the Valar were thrown down and destroyed, and Almaren lay in ruins.  Tulkas gave chase, but Melkor escaped into the dungeons of Utumno.After this, the Valar left Middle-earth and seldom returned.  They founded a new land far away to the west, in Aman, that they called Valinor; a land lit by the fabled light of the Two Trees.

	The continent on which the Valar made their home after the destruction of Almaren.  There they founded Valinor, and there dwelt the Calaquendi; the Vanyar, the Noldor and those of the Teleri who journeyed from Middle-earth long before the First Age.  There were dwellers in Aman before the Valar, though; Ungoliant had long existed in the southern land of Avathar.To protect their realm from Melkor, the Valar raised a great range of mountains along the borders of Aman; the Pel&#243;ri or Mountains of Defence.  They also filled the seas eastwards with shadows and Enchanted Isles.In II 3319, King Ar-Pharaz&#244;n of N&#250;menor, having been seduced and corrupted by Sauron, sailed on Aman with a great fleet.  The King and his armies were destroyed, as was the land of N&#250;menor, and Aman was taken out of the World.  After that catastrophe, only the Elves could reach the Blessed Realm.

	The eldest son of E&#228;rendur and direct descendant of Isildur; Amlaith was the first King of Arthedain.
	Notes
	1
	The date of Amlaith's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable.
	2
	The meaning of Amlaith's name is extremely obscure.  The initial am- element is probably 'up', but -laith is much more difficult to interpret.  The only other appearance of this element is in the name Limlaith, an Elvish name for the River Limlight, so on this rather shaky basis we can translate laith as 'light'.  Why Amlaith should choose to name himself 'up-light' is a mystery - perhaps it hints at a lost story of Amlaith's youth, or perhaps Tolkien was simply lighting his pipe as he thought up the name!  Whatever the reason, it is now lost to us.
	3
	Amlaith's younger brothers (whose names were frustratingly never recorded) were the founders of the kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur. It should be noted that there is no specific evidence that Amlaith had only two brothers, and indeed there is the vaguest of hints in The Peoples of Middle-earth that he may have had more, but if so they left no mark on the history of Middle-earth.

	A hill raised by the people of Finrod in the wide plain of Talath Dirnen, a league (approximately three miles) east of the Doors of Nargothrond above the river Narog.  Over the years, trees grew on its flanks, but from its clear summit the watchers of Nargothrond could watch the lands about with the clear sight of the Elves, and so the hill got its name, Amon Ethir, meaning 'Hill of Spies'.
	After the Sack of Nargothrond, the hill still stood, and it was here that Nienor encountered Glaurung the Dragon.  Having plunged the land into a thick fog of dragon-reek, so that only the hill remained above the mists, he cast Nienor into a deep spell of forgetfulness, a state in which her guardian Mablung finally found her.  He led her away from the hill into the north, but on the borders of Doriath she became lost, and from the Dragon's spell on Amon Ethir many evils later came.

	1
	The dating evidence for the works of Men on Amon Hen is slight.  Aragorn says that they were made '...in the days of the great kings' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 9) but this is open to interpretation.  There were many great constructions of this kind during the time when Isildur and An&#225;rion held the joint rule of Gondor, and it is assumed here that the Seat of Amon Hen was among them.

	Notes
	1
	In Aldarion and Erendis, Aldarion visited the 'land of Amroth' on his second journey to Middle-earth, which took place on about this date.
	2
	There are a number of contradictory sources on this point - see the discussion of Amroth's family below (note 4).
	3
	According to some versions of the story, Amroth was the inventor of the talan or flet, hence this name.  In some sources, most notably Appendix F of The Lord of the Rings, it is suggested that the name Amroth is originally from a Silvan dialect.
	4
	The issue of Amroth's descent is not entirely certain - a number of versions are given in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth.  The version given here appears to be most consistent with the information given in The Lord of the Rings, but others exist.In particular, one tradition states that Amroth was the son of Celeborn and Galadriel - Christopher Tolkien suggests that this idea post-dates the publication of The Lord of the Rings, and was later rejected in its turn.  In another version, the details are broadly similar to that given above, but the earlier King of L&#243;rien (never explicitly identified as Amroth's father) is Malgalad, not Amd&#237;r.

	The Sun
	During the Years of the Trees, Valinor was lit for many thousands of years by the light of the Two Trees, Telperion the Silver and Laurelin the Gold.  When these were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, the World was plunged into darkness.  Through the power of Nienna and Yavanna, though, Laurelin produced a single fiery fruit before it died.  This golden fire was set in a vessel, and steered into the sky by the Maia Arien. The Vanyar gave it the name Anar the fire-golden: this was the origin of the Sun.Valinor was in the West of the World, and the so the first sunrise was in the west, not the east.  Originally, Arien was to have steered Anar ceaselessly from west to east and back again, always remaining in the sky, but the Valar changed this counsel, so that each evening Anar would descend into the distant western seas, and re-emerge each morning in the east.

	At the dawning of N&#250;menor's pride and power, Meneldur the King's Heir of that island Kingdom had a son whom he named Anardil.  That Anardil grew up to rule as the famous sixth King of N&#250;menor, who allied himself with Gil-galad and founded N&#250;menor's first footholds in Middle-earth, though he ruled under the better known name of Tar-Aldarion. Three thousand years later, another Anardil became the sixth King of another realm - Anardil son of E&#228rendil succeeded his father to become the ruler of Gondor.Anardil's reign over Gondor was uneventful.  He is perhaps most notable as the last of Gondor's Kings to dwell exclusively in Osgiliath, since his son Ostoher was to set the precedent of the Kings spending summer in Minas Anor, the citadel later known as Minas Tirith.Anardil ruled Gondor for eighty-seven years, and was succeeded by his son, Ostoher.

	While Tar-Elendil ruled as the fourth King of N&#250;menor, his Heir Meneldur had a son of his own.  He named that child Anardil, 'Devoted to the Sun', perhaps because of the golden hair the boy had inherited from Almarian, his mother.  He quickly grew to become a proud but generous youth, and became enamoured of sea-going and adventure.
	As his experience and reputation as a mariner grew, he planted great forests to provide wood for ship-building, and from them he received his more famous name, Aldarion, probably meaning 'son of the trees'.  Almost all records of his life refer to him has 'Aldarion' rather than 'Anardil', or (after he inherited the Kingship) as 'Tar-Aldarion'.  There are a very few exceptions: his 'official' full name as King's Heir seems to have been 'Anardil Aldarion', while his grandfather V&#235;antur called him Anardilya, a familiar form of his birth-name.

	Tolkien provides no explicit derivation for the name An&#225;rion, so 'Sun-son' is a little speculative.  The name of An&#225;rion's brother Isildur means approximately 'devoted to the Moon', so the implication is that An&#225;rion's name refers to the son of Elendil dedicated to Anar, the Sun.

To the east, it bordered the Forostar and Mittalmar regions, but in all other directions it was surrounded by the ocean.The Andustar was a generally fertile region, except along its northern coasts, where the landscape became higher and rockier, and forested by firs.  Its western shores were broken by three bays, with the northernmost of these being the Bay of And&#250;ni&#235;.  On the high land around this bay, the N&#250;men&#243;reans built the port and city of And&#250;ni&#235;, whose Lords were to be the ancestors of the Kings of Arnor and Gondor.

	Angband was a mighty fortified citadel originally constructed by Melkor in the earliest days of the world as an outlying fortress to his northern stronghold of Utumno.  Utumno was destroyed by the Valar, and Melkor imprisoned in Valinor for three ages, but on his return to Middle-earth, he took Angband as the seat of his power, and raised the towers of Thangorodrim above its gates.Angband was beseiged by the Noldor during the early part of the First Age, but the Siege of Angband was broken at the Dagor Bragollach.  It was finally destroyed by the forces of the Valar at the end of the First Age, in the War of the Wrath. Origins and History Melkor built Angband during the Years of the Trees2, originally as an outlying fortress and armoury to his great northern citadel at Utumno.  It was commanded from its first construction by Sauron, the chief of Melkor's servants.  Angband was built near the northwestern shores of the Great Sea in the range of the Iron Mountains, as a first defence against any attack on Melkor's realm from the Valar in Aman.When the Valar captured Melkor and took him in chains back to Valinor, Angband was largely destroyed and lay in ruins for many thousands of years, although beneath the ruins lay many hidden chambers in which some of Melkor's servants escaped the Valar's assault.  Sauron was one of these, and the Balrogs lay hid with him in Angband's deepest vaults.Angband re-entered history when Melkor escaped Valinor with the stolen Silmarils: he chose the ruined fortress as his new capital, and rebuilt the Hells of Iron as a base for the dark reign he intended for the lands of Middle-earth.Soon after the Return of the Noldor to Beleriand, Morgoth took Maedhros F&#235;anor's son by deceit and trickery, and hung him by the wrist from the towers of Thangorodrim above Angband.  He was rescued by Fingon and Thorondor, but lost his right hand.The third of the great battles in the Wars of Beleriand, the Dagor Aglareb, had profound consequences for Angband.  Until that time (about the year 75 of the First Age) Morgoth sent out hosts of Orcs in the hope of taking the Noldor by surprise.  The Noldor, though, chased these Orcs back to the very gates of Angband, and slew them to the last creature.  From then until the Dagor Bragollach in I 455, a period of almost 400 years, Angband was surrounded by the Noldor; this is the time known as the Siege of Angband.Appearance and ConstructionAngband was primarily an underground fortress, at least after its initial destruction by the Valar in the Years of the Trees.  Like its prototype, Utumno, it had many hidden underground chambers and vaults far beneath the earth.  Its main features above ground were the three peaks of the Thangorodrim, mighty towers of ash and slag raised above Angband's gates.The peaks of Thangorodrim were hollow, and from them channels and chimneys ran down to the deepest pits of Angband.  So, Morgoth could produce poisonous clouds and vapours, as indeed he sent against the Noldor in Mithrim during the first days after their Return.
	Notes

	While the map that accompanies The Silmarillion does not show the location of Angband, there are a wealth of hints and pointers in that work to help us to place it with some degree of certainty.

	Origins:
	Made by E&#246;l the Dark Elf, presumably in Doriath2

	Originally made and used by Elves, but latterly borne by T&#250;rin Turambar, a Man

	Meaning:

	Other&nbsp;names:
	Known after its reforging as Gurthang, Iron of Death
	'Iron of the Flaming Star', the sword forged by E&#246;l the Dark Elf and borne by Beleg of Doriath.  It was later reforged as T&#250;rin's black sword, Gurthang.
	Notes
	1
	We can date Anglachel to the years before the First Age because it was given up by E&#246;l as a fee, so that Thingol would allow him to dwell in Nan Elmoth outside the Girdle of Melian.  The Girdle was raised before the First Age began, so Anglachel must date from that period, too.
	2
	If Anglachel was part of Thingol's price for allowing E&#246;l to go and dwell in Nan Elmoth, it follows that it cannot have been made there.  Given this fact, it must surely have been forged in Doriath in the time when E&#246;l dwelt in that land with his kin.
	3
	The 'flaming star' in Anglachel's name is a reference to its origin.  With its mate Anguirel, it was made from exceptionally strong iron recovered from a fallen meteorite.

The only specific detail we have is that E&#246;l kept it for himself, but it was stolen by his son Maeglin.  This must have happened when Maeglin and his mother Aredhel fled Nan Elmoth for Gondolin, so presumably the sword was taken to Turgon's Hidden City.  What became of it after that is unknown.

	D&#250;nedain
	Pronunciation:
	anoo'meenass
	Meaning:
	'West-tower'2
	The city of the Kings of Arnor, on the shores of Nenuial. The city was founded by Elendil himself, on the shores of the northern lake  Nenuial, near the sources of the Baranduin.  It was the chief city of the Kings of Arnor for several centuries, and home to one of the three palant&#237;ri of the North-Kingdom.The available evidence suggests that the city survived for nearly a thousand years.  In the early days of Arnor, it must have been one of the glories of Middle-earth.  Soon after its founding, though, the numbers of the D&#250;nedain of the North began to dwindle.  The population of Ann&#250;minas seems to have fallen throughout its history, until eventually it was deserted, and the Kings removed to Fornost to the east.It seems likely that the people of Ann&#250;minas were dependent on the River Baranduin for their contact with the outside world.  While the Hills of Evendim surrounded the city to the west and south, the city's people could reach the other cities of the D&#250;nedain that lay along the river3 by boat.After the city's desertion, it fell into decay, but two relics of its greatness survived: its palant&#237;r and the Sceptre of Ann&#250;minas. The palant&#237;r remained in Middle-earth for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with Arvedui in the cold northern seas.The silver Sceptre of Ann&#250;minas was the symbol of Kingship in the North-kingdom.  A very ancient thing, it was originally the rod of office of the N&#250;men&#243;rean Lords of And&#250;ni&#235;. Though it would have been removed to Fornost by the Kings, and eventually came to be kept by Elrond in Rivendell, it retained the name of its ancient home of Ann&#250;minas.At the time of the coronation of Aragorn at the end of the Third Age, Ann&#250;minas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years.  There are hints in The History of Middle-earth though, that Aragorn refounded the city and may even have made it his capital.  No definite statement on this matter appears in the canonical works, though, so this must be considered speculation.
	Notes
	1
	At the Council of Elrond, Elrond recounts some of the history of Ann&#250;minas: '...after the war and slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Ann&#250;minas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost...' (The Lord of the Rings II 2 The Council of Elrond). This suggests an early abandonment, perhaps even by Valandil's immediate successor, Eldacar. The earliest date possible, then, is III 249, the year of Eldacar's accession, though the phrase 'heirs of Valandil' suggests that Ann&#250;minas was abandoned somewhat later than this.It seems reasonable to assume that Ann&#250;minas was abandoned some centuries later, at the time of the break-up of Arnor in III 861, and this seems to be confirmed by a note in volume 12 of The History of Middle-earth: 'After E&#228;rendur the Northern Kingdom of Arnor was broken up ... Ann&#250;minas became deserted owing to the dwindling of the people.' (The Peoples of Middle-earth I 7 The Heirs of Elendil).
	2
	Though 'West-tower' is a literal translation into English, it isn't an entirely happy one. The Elvish word ann&#251;n is strictly not just 'west' but 'in the direction of the sunset'.  Hence, Ann&#250;minas can equally be rendered 'Sunset-tower'.  This is particularly relevant because the city lay in a region called Evendim (that is, 'evening twilight').
	3
	At Arnor's height, there were settlements of the D&#250;nedain throughout Eriador. According to The Silmarillion, they '...dwelt in many places in Eriador about the courses of the Lh&#251;n and the Baranduin...' (from Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age).  None of these settlements seem to have survived to the end of the Third Age.

	&nbsp;&#149; Flame of Anor
	The name for the Sun in the Sindarin language.  It appears in many names, including Minas Anor, the original name for Minas Tirith, meaning 'Tower of the Setting Sun'.  It is also seen in the flower-name elanor, 'sunstar', and perhaps in the title Gandalf claimed for himself on the Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m, 'wielder of the flame of Anor'.

Ants
	[ants.txt]
	Tiny insects that form large communal colonies under the rule of a single queen.  Though Tolkien doesn't mention them directly, we can deduce their presence in Middle-earth from the fact that Merry discusses them briefly with Pippin on one occasion.  Tolkien uses their qualities freely in similes throughout The Lord of the Rings, especially in reference to the Orcs of Mordor, whose military organisation and aggression are referred to several times as being ant-like.  At one point Sauron is compared to an ant queen, with his Orcs acting as soldiers and workers just as the queen's in her colony.

Early in his reign, the Watchful Peace came to an end as Sauron returned to Dol Guldur, and soon afterwards the White Council was formed.  Some years later, Orcs that had been secretly establishing themselves in the Misty Mountains suddenly revealed themselves, and the roads eastward into Eriador became all but impassable.  Arahad's reign lasted sixty-eight years; he was succeeded by his son, Aragost.

	Arahael was the first of Isildur's Heirs to be born after the destruction of the North-kingdom.  His father Aranarth therefore gave him over to Elrond, to be fostered in Rivendell, and this became the custom of the Chieftains of the North.Some decades before Arahael assumed the leadership of his people, Gandalf had gone to Dol Guldur and driven its master into the east.  The Witch-king, who had ravaged the realm of Arahael's grandfather Arvedui two generations before, was far to the south in Minas Morgul.  So, Arahael led the D&#250;nedain during the time known as the Watchful Peace, and was untroubled by war.Arahael served as Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain for seventy-one years. He was succeeded by his son Aranuir.

	&nbsp;&#149; House of Elendil
	&nbsp;&#149; King of Arthedain
	The elder son of King Arvedui of Arthedain, who would have become King himself in turn, if not for the destruction his father's Kingdom by the Witch-king of Angmar.  When Aranarth was still a young man by the reckoning of his people, the Witch-king's armies swept into Arthedain and overran it. Fornost was taken, but the King and his son escaped. Arvedui fled into the north, but Aranarth, like most of his people, escaped westwards across the River Lh&#251;n into Lindon.At Aranarth's urging, C&#237;rdan sent a ship into the north to recover his father, but it never returned.  It was later learned that the ship had rescued Arvedui, but had been lost with him aboard in the icy northern seas.  So Aranarth inherited the leadership of the scattered and diminished northern D&#250;nedain, but he took the title Chieftain, rather than King, since his father's realm was lost.The D&#250;nedain were to have their revenge soon after, though, with the arrival of the Gondorian prince and general E&#228;rnur, the son and heir of E&#228;rnil II.  He sailed into Lindon, and then marched eastwards to rout the armies of Angmar.  Of Aranarth's activities during this campaign we know nothing, but all available evidence suggests that he was in Lindon when E&#228;rnur arrived there, and so it seems very likely that he marched with E&#228;rnur's forces and saw the defeat of his ancient enemy with his own eyes.Aranarth served as Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain for 131 years. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Arahael.

	At the time Araphant inherited his kingdom from his father Araval, Arthedain was already in desperate straits.  The Witch-king of Angmar had been beleaguering the northern lands for nearly five hundred years, and Arthedain's resistance was beginning to fail.The one hope that Araphant had left was to renew the ancient bond with the South-kingdom of Gondor, which was at that time suffering losses itself at the hands of the Wainriders.  He forged an alliance with King Ondoher of Gondor, and sealed it with the wedding of his son Arvedui to Ondoher's daughter F&#237;riel.  Araphant's foresight failed to bring help to his kingdom, though, since Gondor itself was under sustained attack and could send no troops to his aid.Four years after the alliance was made, Ondoher fell in battle with the Wainriders, and the South-kingdom was left Kingless.  Araphant's heir Arvedui made a claim to the Kingship of Gondor, which would have reunited the two Kingdoms, but Steward Pelendur moved the Gondorians to reject it.Araphant ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years.  He was succeeded by his son Arvedui, who would be the last of the northern Kings.

	The son of Arveleg I came early to the throne of Arthedain.  While he was still in his youth (probably no more than eighteen years old), the Witch-king of Angmar launched a mighty invasion of his kingdom, that came close to destroying it.  Araphor's father Arveleg fought in the defence of the Tower of Amon S&#251;l, and his early death in that battle brought Araphor to the throne.Records of the events of this time are incomplete, but it seems that the Witch-king laid siege to the royal city of Fornost.  The young Araphor went to war with aid from C&#237;rdan and the Elves of Lindon, and succeeded in relieving the siege and driving back the forces of Angmar.After Araphor's defeat of Angmar, there is no record of further warfare during his long reign. Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling people; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern D&#250;nedain come close to destruction. Rhudaur was now a tributary state to Angmar, and the D&#250;nedain of Cardolan were all but extinct.Araphor ruled Arthedain for one hundred and eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, named for Araphor's heroic grandfather Argeleb, who ruled as Argeleb II.

Gilraen at that time was just twenty-two years old, and though the wedding was at first opposed by her father D&#237;rhael, she became Arathorn's wife.The following year, Arathorn's father Arador was slain by trolls, and Arathorn took on the title of Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain. Gilraen bore him a son, who was given the name Aragorn.  Aragorn would not know his father for long - when he was just two years old, Arathorn went hunting orcs, and was shot through the eye by an arrow.  After Arathorn's loss, Gilraen took their son to Rivendell to be fostered by Elrond.Arathorn II served as Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain for just three years.  He was succeeded by his only son, who would become Chieftain Aragorn II, and in time King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of the D&#250;nedain.
	Notes
	1
	The date of Arathorn's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable, but it is at least partly confirmed by D&#237;rhael's words in The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen: '...Arathorn is a stern man of full age...' These words seem to have been spoken in III 2929, so Arathorn would have been fifty-six years old at that time.
	2
	Tolkien reveals something of the etymology of Arathorn's name in a late letter: 'The name contains an abbreviated form of &#254;orono (thorono) 'eagle', seen in Thoron- dor, Thorongil...' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 347, dated 1972).

	The son of Arveleg II was born into a time of war and strife.  At the time of his birth, his father's realm of Arthedain had been under threat from the eastern land of Angmar for more than four hundred years.Araval, too, played his part in the war with Angmar.  The Lord of the Rings tells us nothing of his career, but The History of Middle-earth hints (in volume 12) that he was a diplomat and a warrior.  In alliance with the Elves of Lindon and Imladris, he won at least one important victory over the Witch-king of Angmar. We are also told that he attempted the recolonisation of Cardolan, though this was prevented by the evil beings, the wights, sent there by the Witch-king some two centuries before.In the end, though, Araval's bravery counted for little.  His grandson Arvedui, who was born in Araval's lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory, was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of Arthedain.Araval ruled Arthedain for seventy-eight years, and was succeeded by his son Araphant.

	1

	The translation 'Black Lord' relies on breaking down the name as ara-vorn.  It could also be interpreted as ar-avorn, which would mean something like 'steadfast lord', though this derivation is somewhat less certain.

	[arda.txt]
	The World
	Meaning:
	'Realm (of Manw&#235;)'
	The shape of Arda before the end of the First Age (somewhat conjectural1)
	In the language of the Elder Days, 'Arda' signified the World and all that is in it.  Arda was created through the Music of the Ainur to be a dwelling place for the Children of Il&#250;vatar (that is, Elves and Men).Originally a flat world, the continents shown in the map above were surrounded by a mighty ocean, Ekkaia or the Encircling Sea, and separated by Belegaer, called the Great Sea.  In the First Age, the regions to the north and west of Middle-earth (the bay marked 'Forochel' on the map) was occupied by the country of Beleriand, but this was destroyed during the tumults of the War of Wrath.In the Second Age, the isle of N&#250;menor was raised in the Great Sea for the Edain to dwell on.  This island existed through most of the Second Age, but was destroyed in the Downfall of N&#250;menor as a result of the pride of the N&#250;menorean people in defying the Ban of the Valar and sailing to Aman in the west.After the Downfall, the shape of Arda was changed, and it was made 'bent' (or 'round' as we should say in modern terms).  Aman was taken out of the world, and could only be reached by the Elves, following the straight road that was granted to them.  As Aman was taken away from Arda, new lands and continents were created.  From the late Second Age onwards, the World began to take the shape that we know today.
	Notes
	1
	The map of Arda shown here is based on Maps IV and (especially) V reproduced by Christopher Tolkien in volume IV of The History of Middle-earth.  These maps belong to an early phase of Tolkien's mythology, and in a few cases the nomenclature of the originals has been updated (for example, Map V refers to the region known in the published Silmarillion as Avathar by its older name Arvalin).The main point of conjecture on the map is the placing of the Ered Luin and Orocarni.  In fact, Map V does not name these mountain ranges, but Map IV shows ranges in these locations, and labels them the 'Blue Mountains' and 'Red Mountains' respectively.  Equally, the range stretching southwest from Helcar into the (unnamed) southern continent might possibly correspond to an older conception of a range known as the Grey Mountains (quite unrelated to the northern range of the same name).It's important to remember that the original maps on which this one is based predate the stories of the Third Age, and aren't entirely compatible with the later geography of Middle-earth.  In particular, the relatively small northern continent would probably need to be rather larger than is shown here to accommodate all the lands that Tolkien later devised.

	Notes
	1
	The details of the Argonath's origins given in this entry are taken from Appendix A (iv) to The Lord of the Rings, which states of R&#243;mendacil II: 'He it was that built the pillars of the Argonath at the entrance to Nen Hithoel.'  R&#243;mendacil was King of Gondor between the years III 1304 and III 1366, but before taking the throne he had served as Regent since III 1240, and the context of this quote strongly suggests that Pillars were raised during his Regency period, in about the year III 1250.To complicate matters, all of this seems to be flatly contradicted by The Silmarillion.  In Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, the raising of the Pillars is apparently described as taking place long before, during the last years of the Second Age: '...works marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of their power, at the Argonath...'  This is probably a simple error (and as the ultimate canonical source, the account in The Lord of the Rings must take precedence).To resolve this apparent contradiction, we might imagine that the 'marvellous works' raised in Elendil's time weren't necessarily the Pillars of the Argonath themselves - perhaps they refer to the long narrow channel that led into Nen Hithoel, with the mighty statues at the entrance to the channel being raised more than a thousand years later by R&#243;mendacil.  It's very doubtful that Tolkien intended any of this, but it does help to reconcile the contradictory accounts.
	2
	In Sindarin, the -ath ending usually indicates a very large number of things, as in Osgiliath ('fortress of the host of stars') or Remmirath ('the many netted jewels').  The -ath ending of Argonath has a quite different etymological origin, though, and signifies 'two'.  For a full treatment of the etymological origins of Argonath, see The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 347.

	The Hobbit 12, Inside Information
	The great jewel discovered beneath the roots of Erebor by Thr&#225;in I soon after the establishment of the Dwarf-kingdom there, and prized by his descendants as the Heart of the Mountain.  The Dwarves used all their skill to work the gem into a shimmering multi-faceted jewel that not only shone by its own pale light, but when light fell upon it, the stone '...changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.' (The Hobbit 13, Not at Home).  It was a heavy gem, small enough for Bilbo to hold in one hand, yet not so small that he could close his own small hand around it.In the centuries after its discovery, the Arkenstone became an heirloom of the Kings of Durin's Folk.  It was carried away into the Grey Mountains by Thr&#225;in's son, and in time brought back to the Great Hall of Thr&#225;in under the Mountain by his descendant Thr&#243;r.  When Smaug sacked Erebor, the Arkenstone was lost to the Dwarves of Durin's Folk - it lay among Smaug's booty in the halls of Erebor.Many years later, when Thorin led a band of Dwarves to recover their ancient city, their companion Bilbo Baggins discovered the Arkenstone, and kept it for himself.  Later, when the Lake-men and Wood-elves came to demand their own shares of Smaug's treasure from Thorin, Bilbo delivered the Arkenstone to them to bargain with.  In the ensuing Battle of Five Armies, though, all enmities were forgotten, and Bard of Dale placed the Heart of the Mountain on the breast of Thorin in his tomb beneath Erebor.  So, nearly a thousand years after its discovery by Thr&#225;in I, the Arkenstone was buried once more in the depths beneath the Lonely Mountain.
	Notes
	1
	The element arken comes from an Old English word, eorcan, meaning 'holy'.  This may seem a strange derivation: despite its beauty and its great importance to the Dwarves, it's hard to claim that the Arkenstone was in any real sense 'holy'.  Instead, it seems to have acquired its name by association with the word Eorclanst&#225;nas ('Holy Stones') the Old English name for the Silmarils themselves.

	arr'norr (all 'r' sounds should be pronounced; 'rr' is used here to emphasise this)
	Founded by Elendil in the last years of the Second Age, Arnor was the great kingdom of Men in the north of Middle-earth.  It lay between the Misty Mountains in the east, and the Blue Mountains on the borders of Lindon in the west, and encompassed the area where the Shire would be founded many years later.  Its capital, and the seat of its Kings, was at Ann&#250;minas on Lake Nenuial.Elendil fell in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r in II 3441, and his eldest son Isildur, who would have taken the rulership, was lost two years later as he journeyed back from the southlands with his three eldest sons.  These were also slain by Orcs at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. Isildur's youngest son Valandil, however, had not gone to the war, and was kept safe in Rivendell; he was accounted the third King of Arnor, though Isildur had never taken the throne.The tenth and last King of Arnor was E&#228;rendur.  After his death in III 861, his three sons each made claims of succession.  This led to the break-up of Arnor into three separate but related kingdoms; Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur.  E&#228;rendur's eldest son, Amlaith of Fornost, became King of Arthedain, and is considered the true heir to the line of Isildur.

	&nbsp;&#149; Faramir
	&nbsp;&#149; King of Gondor
	The elder son and heir of King Ondoher of Gondor, who marched with his father to war with the Wainriders.  Ondoher's force met with a surprise assault beneath the Black Gate of the Morannon, where the King and his son Artamir were slain.  It was later discovered that Artamir's younger brother Faramir had also ridden to war, against the laws and customs of Gondor, and had himself been lost in the battle, leaving Gondor without a King.A political crisis ensued, in which Arvedui the northern King of Arthedain pressed a strong claim to the Crown of Gondor. Arvedui's claim was rejected by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, who instead gave the Kingship to E&#228;rnil, the victorious Captain who also belonged to the Royal House.  E&#228;rnil's line was short-lived, however, and ended with the presumed loss of his son E&#228;rnur in Minas Morgul.The loss of Artamir was a turning point in the history of Middle-earth.  Had he not perished, the line of Kings would almost certainly have survived the coming crisis and lasted into the third millennium of the Third Age.  A thousand years later, Aragorn would have found Minas Tirith ruled not by a Steward but by a legitimate King, so preventing him from claiming the Crown himself.  The unknown Wainrider who cut down Artamir, then, unknowingly paved the way for the reunification of Arnor and Gondor more than a thousand years later.

	It was the custom of the Elves that a child's father should give a name to his newborn son or daughter, and so when Finarfin's youngest child was born, his only daughter, he chose the name Artanis, meaning 'noble woman'.  As an adult, Artanis took a different name, a name in the Sindarin tongue meaning 'radiant garland' - Galadriel.

	Last Realm of the Northern Kings
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	III 861 to III 1974 (endured 1,113 years)
	Location:
	Western Eriador
	Origins:
	One of three kingdoms formed from the breakup of Arnor
	Race:
	Men
	Division:
	D&#250;nedain
	Pronunciation:
	a'rthedine
	Meaning:
	Perhaps 'Lords of the Edain'1
	Political map of Arthedain and its neighbouring lands III 861 - III 1974
	The westernmost region of the lost realm of Arnor; when that land was divided between the sons of E&#228;rendur, Arthedain became a kingdom in its own right, and was ruled by E&#228;rendur's eldest son Amlaith and his decendants.
	Notes
	1
	arth- is uncertain.  We assume here that it descends from *arath-, '(many) lords'. This assumption is certainly open to debate, but is supported by an old alternative name for this region, Dunhirion, the meaning of which we can state with much more certainty: '(Land) of the West-lords'.This rendering also makes sense in political as well as etymological terms: the realm of Arthedain was ruled by the direct descendants of the Kings of Arnor, who claimed suzerainty over their sister-states of Cardolan and Rhudaur.

He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the D&#250;nedain) when the Great Plague came out of the south and ravaged Eriador, but the seat of the Kings at Fornost in the north was little affected.Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, longer than any of his descendants until Aragorn, as is noted in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings.  By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death.  Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father Argeleb II and his grandfather Araphor.Arvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Arveleg II.

	The beginning and the end of the Arveleg's reign were forged in battle and in war.  He became King when his father Argeleb I went to war with the newly allied lands of Rhudaur and Angmar, and was slain.  Arveleg made an alliance of his own, with the Men of Cardolan and the Elves of Lindon, and struck back at the eastern lands.These two allied forces seem to have cancelled one another out.  For more than fifty years, Arveleg was able to hold a defensive line stretching east from Weathertop, through which Angmar could not break.  Rivendell did not fall behind this frontier, it seems, and suffered a siege at this time.At last the balance broke: Angmar gathered its forces and breached the frontier.  Crossing the River Hoarwell, its armies marched westward and surrounded Weathertop, destroying its Tower and sending the troops of Arthedain in retreat back to Fornost.  Arveleg died in that assault, and his young son Araphor came to the throne.Arveleg I ruled Arthedain for fifty-three years, and was succeeded by his son, Araphor.

	Race:
	Orcs
	Pronunciation:
	Probably 'ahzog', rather than the more natural 'ayzog'
	AZOGBolg
	An Orc-chieftain of Moria, who started the War of the Dwarves and Orcs when he slew Thr&#243;r. He was himself slain by D&#225;in Ironfoot in the Battle of Azanulbizar, and was succeeded by his son Bolg.Of Azog's origins we know little; he was the chief of the Orcs of Moria, and apparently the most important Orc of the northern lands.  The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to Moria by Sauron in about III 2480.  He had one son that we know of, Bolg, who succeeded him after his death.Azog entered history in the year III 2790 due to King Thr&#243;r's desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of Khazad-d&#251;m, in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt.  Azog captured and slew Thr&#243;r, and branded his hewn head with his own name, AZOG:When news of this reached Thr&#243;r's heir Thr&#225;in, he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of Dwarves to seek revenge on Azog.  So began the War of the Dwarves and Orcs: the Dwarves hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth.  After nine years of war, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar was fought before the gates of Moria itself.King Thr&#225;in and his son Thorin were in that battle (it was here that Thorin gained the surname Oakenshield).  Near the end of the battle, Azog himself emerged and fought with Thr&#225;in's cousin N&#225;in and, after breaking N&#225;in's neck, his young son D&#225;in.  Though only 32 years old, D&#225;in swept the head from Azog's shoulders, and helped to win the day.The Dwarves made no attempt to press their advantage, though, because D&#225;in had glimpsed Durin's Bane during his battle, and warned the Dwarves not to attempt to enter Moria.  Azog's underground dominions in the north, though greatly reduced in the War, fell to his son Bolg, who held them for more than 150 years until he too met his end at the Battle of Five Armies.

	Race:

	Family:
	Baggins
	A large and comfortable hobbit-hole, well-known as the home of Bilbo Baggins and his heir, Frodo.  Its round green door opened into a large, well-appointed hobbit-hole that took up much of the Hill above Hobbiton.  In the tradition of hobbit-holes, all the rooms at Bag End were on the same level, and there were many of these; '...bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes ([Bilbo] had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms...'2.
	Notes
	1
	The exact date that Bag End came into existence is unknown, but we do know that it was excavated by Bilbo Baggins' father Bungo, after he had married Belladonna Took: 'Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money)...'.  The latest possible date for the building of Bag End is III 2926, the year of Bungo's death, but the context of the text quoted here seems to suggest that Bungo built it rather earlier than this.

It is said that the Maia Oss&#235; often came to the Isle of Balar.The island was noted for its pearls, which were found in great abundance in the shallow waters around it.  These were collected by the people of C&#237;rdan, who gave them freely to the other Elf-lords.While we are not told of the nature or location of settlements on the island, it is clear that it was populated at least early in the First Age, and possibly before that.  As well as the Elves of the Havens, Balar was explored by the people of Nargothrond, and Turgon built refuges there for the Gondolindrim after the Dagor Bragollach in 455 (First Age).  From these, he sent out ships seeking Aman and the aid of the Valar, but none succeeded.The Isle of Balar became an important centre after the destruction of the Havens in 472 (First Age), when C&#237;rdan and Gil-galad fled to the island and settled there.  While it is not stated certainly, it is likely that E&#228;rendil's ship Vingilot was built here, and that the Mariner set out for the West from C&#237;rdan's havens on the Island.

	The Balrogs originated as Maiar, beings of the same kind as Sauron himself.  They were primordial spirits of fire that had allied themselves with Melkor in ancient times, and became the most feared of his servants, especially during the Wars of Beleriand in the First Age.  Details of their numbers are hard to state with certainty, but there seem to have been relatively few of them - probably no more than seven.
	In appearance, the Balrogs were man-like, but fire streamed from them, and they were swathed in dark shadows.  They carried whips of flame and induced great terror in friends and foes alike. In the War of Wrath, Morgoth was assailed by the forces of the Valar.  Most of the Balrogs were destroyed in that War, but some few escaped over the Blue Mountains and hid in Middle-earth.  Durin's Bane, the creature that drove the Dwarves from Moria, was one of these.
	The Balrogs Before the First AgeThe Balrogs were in origin Maiar, of the same order as Sauron or Gandalf.  Melkor corrupted them to his service in the distant past of the World, in the days of his splendour.  They were originally gathered by him in his ancient fastness of Utumno during the time of the Lamps of the Valar.  When this fortress was destroyed by the Valar, at least some fled and lurked in the pits of Angband (whether any of the original Balrogs were slain in the Valar's attack on Utumno is not known).
	Balrogs in the First AgeWhen Melkor and Ungoliant escaped from Valinor three ages later with the Silmarils, the Balrogs were still to be found in the ruins of Angband.  Ungoliant trapped Melkor in her webs, demanding the Silmarils for herself, but the Balrogs issued from their hiding-place and rescued their lord.
	The Balrogs were apparently first encountered by the Elves during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath in the first year of the First Age.  After the great victory of the Noldor over Morgoth's Orcs, F&#235;anor pressed on towards Angband, but the Balrogs came against him.  He was mortally wounded by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs.  Though his sons beat off the demons of fire, F&#235;anor died of his wounds soon after, and his spirit departed for the Halls of Mandos.
	The Appearance and Nature of BalrogsBalrogs were spirits of fire - their hearts were of fire, we are told, and they carried whips of flame.  They could, however, shroud themselves in darkness and shadow.  The Balrog that Gandalf fought in Moria, for example, at first gave no hint of his fiery nature apart from the flames that issued from his nostrils.
	&#145;...And Whether Balrogs Have Wings&#146;Do Balrogs have wings?  It might seem a simple question, but (as so often with Tolkien's work) the more we examine it, the harder it is to answer.  It's a question, too, that divides Tolkien's more avid readers into two distinct camps - those who believe in Balrog wings, and those who deny their existence.It's also a question that generates a lot of interest: we get more e-mail on this single topic than from any other article on the site.  Accordingly, we've revised and expanded this section to cover the vexed 'Balrog wing' question in a fair amount of detail.  If you're a casual browser, or you're not particularly interested in Balrog wings, you'll probably find far more information here than you need!  Feel free to 'bail out' whenever you feel like it - this article is really written for those with a determined interest in the debate.This article does its best to take an objective view, but it does reach a fairly definite conclusion (at least, as definite as the evidence allows).  If you're one of those with strongly-held views on this question, then, there's a fair chance that you'll disagree.  That's fine, of course - we're not looking to 'convert' anyone! - but at least we hope you'll find something of interest here.A Quick Digression: What is &#145;Shadow&#146;?Before starting out, it will be helpful to clear up a common misconception.  Within this debate, a number of references to 'shadow' crop up, and a lot of readers seem to take this in its modern sense - that is, a region of darkness caused by light being blocked.  This isn't quite the sense Tolkien intends.Where Balrogs are concerned, their 'shadow' isn't just a lack of light, but a region of darkness that they carry around with them.  Exactly what its qualities are is a debatable point, but it can certainly flow into different shapes.  These shadow-shapes, in fact, form the beginning of the whole debate.The Nature of the ArgumentThe heart of the debate lies in The Fellowship of the Ring II 5, The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m.  This chapter is built around the Fellowship's disastrous encounter with the Balrog known only as Durin's Bane, the same creature that had driven the Dwarves from their ancient home centuries before.  In particular, two references give rise to the discussion.  The first describes the Balrog from Gandalf's point of view:   [1] "His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mOn its own, this isn't particularly contentious.  The Balrog's dark 'shadow' has assumed a form that appears at least somewhat winglike.  The fact that it is explicitly 'like wings' means that this can't literally describe real wings.  The problems start, though, with another reference that appears two paragraphs later:   [2] "...suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall..."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mThese are quite probably the most hotly debated words Tolkien ever wrote.  This seems strange at first, because in fact most people agree that the meaning isn't particularly ambiguous, and that it's fairly obvious what the statement means.  The dispute begins, though, with a curious fact: like an optical illusion, this quotation has two obvious interpretations. Whatever you think it means, and however sure you are, there are plenty of people who see it quite differently.To one group of readers, 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) relates to the immediately preceding 'the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings' (1). To them, it just reinforces the preceding statement, and says nothing about any other kind of wings.  On the opposite side of the debate, 'its wings were spread' (2) is not related to the preceding statement at all.  Instead, it's a definite reference to the Balrog's real, physical wings.The debate normally focuses on arguments about which of these two obvious interpretations is the correct one.  It's probable, though, that neither is explicitly correct: how you read the passage depends on what you already presume a Balrog to look like. We're not trying to draw any definite conclusions at this point, just to show that the structure of the sentence will bear either interpretation.  One way of doing this is to replace the disputed 'wings' with terms that have a more certain status.Let's start with 'arms'.  There's absolutely no question that Balrogs had arms - it's so obvious that it seems odd to even mention it.  Now, imagine that Tolkien had written 'the shadow about it reached out like two vast arms'.  That's still obviously a simile, just like the real text (1).   If that's followed shortly afterwards by 'its arms were spread', it seems natural to read this second reference as referring to its real arms, not its shadow-arms, even though we've just been told that it had 'arms' of shadow.  This is how the pro-wings faction sees the text, because they assume that Balrogs have real wings, just as unquestionably as real arms.We can simulate the alternative view with 'tentacles'.  There's absolutely no evidence for Balrog tentacles, and its safe to presume that they didn't form any part of a Balrog's anatomy.  Once again, 'the shadow about it reached out like two vast tentacles' reads without a problem as a simile.  Now, though, when it's followed by 'its tentacles were spread', the natural interpretation is slightly different.  We know for sure that there are no 'real' Balrog tentacles, so the statement reads much more easily as referring back to the preceding simile: it must mean 'tentacles of shadow'.  This is the anti-wings position: because they assume that Balrogs have no real wings, they naturally see 'its wings' as an extension of the earlier passage.You might not agree with both of these interpretations, but its fair bet that the one you do agree with is the one you already presume is correct.  That's all we're arguing here - that the interpretation depends on an underlying presumption about Balrog wings, whether for or against.Since there doesn't seem to be anything decisive in the sentence structure itself, it follows that arguments based on this passage alone must be circular.  On the one side: 'Assuming Balrogs have real wings, then the passage must be meant literally, therefore Balrogs have real wings'. On the other: 'Assuming Balrogs have no real wings, then the passage must be meant figuratively, therefore Balrogs have no real wings'. As far as this passage is concerned, whatever you assume about Balrog wings inevitably turns out to be true.This isn't much help, but fortunately 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) isn't the only evidence to consider.  Let's move on to look at the rest of the cases for, and against, real Balrog wings.The Case For Balrog WingsHaving established that 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) can't realistically be used as an argument for (or against) real wings, we can proceed to see what evidence actually can be produced.Argument One: Its Wings Were Spread From Wall to WallIt's a characteristic of the debate that this resilient passage reappears very regularly in pro-wing arguments, whatever counterarguments are put up against it.  It's only fair, then, to allow it another quick airing before moving on.  Those who propose it as proof consider that it is unambiguously literal, and cannot be interpreted otherwise.This position doesn't seem to stand up to detailed scrutiny.  It isn't clear, for example, how a passage that has been subject to years of debate can realistically be described as unambiguous.  Much more interesting, though, is the claim that it must be intended literally.  This presumably means that Tolkien would have written 'its wings of shadow were spread...', or something of the kind, if that is what he had meant.  Consider the following, though:   [3] "Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company"   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mThis occurs just a few pages before Gandalf's encounter with the Balrog, and of course itsmeaning is obvious: Gandalf has been thrown down the steps by a force from above. This is a metaphor: nobody would claim that Gandalf literally 'flew'.  The text, though, doesn't say 'Gandalf seemed to come flying', it says unequivocally that he 'came flying'.  Those who insist on a literal reading of one passage, must logically insist on a literal reading of this passage too. The only consistent conclusion is that, if 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) proves that Balrogs have real wings, then 'Gandalf came flying down the steps' (3) proves that Gandalf not only could fly, but chose that moment to show off his talent.AddendumSince this article was originally created, a reference has come to light that has very clear relevance to the discussion. The text in question appears in Malbeth's prophecy about the Paths of the Dead, in which he foresees the great darkness that Mount Doom spews across the western lands in the days before the Battle of the Pelennor.   "Over the land there lies a long shadow,westward reaching wings of darkness."   The Return of the King V 2 The Passing of the Grey CompanyOf course, there's no question of this being intended literally (if it were, we would have to imagine Mount Doom with gigantic wings hundreds of miles long!) We can see, then, that not only was Tolkien happy to use 'wings' in metaphorical way, but also that he expressly associated that metaphor with the idea of shadow.  This establishes beyond doubt that the idea of 'wings of shadow' need not be taken literally.Thanks are due to sharp-eyed reader Darren Brewer for pointing out this reference.Argument Two: &#145;With Winged Speed&#146;Given the depth of debate on the issue, it may come as a surprise that 'Its wings were spread...' (2) is the only definite canonical evidence for Balrog wings.  There is, though, a passage in The History of Middle-earth that is often produced as supporting evidence.  Here it is:   [4] "Swiftly they arose, and they passed with winged speed over Hithlum, and they came to Lammoth as a tempest of fire."   The History of Middle-earth Volume X (Morgoth's Ring), The Later Quenta Silmarillion: Of the Rape of the Silmarils'They' are the Balrogs who rushed to save Melkor from Ungoliant immediately after his return to Middle-earth.  This text does not appear in the published Silmarillion: it belongs to an unpublished variant, often claimed to have canonical priority over the published edition.  To avoid unnecessary debate about canon and priority, we'll assume it does have priority for the purposes of this argument.Regardless of its canonical status, though, it isn't certain how this represents 'proof' of any kind: 'with winged speed' is unavoidably just a metaphor for 'very quickly'.  Actually, there does seem to be some disagreement about the metaphorical status of this phrase, so we'll take a moment to consult the dictionarry:   [5] "metaphor n. application of name or descriptive term or phrase to an object or action to which it is imaginatively but not literally applicable"   The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current EnglishIn other words, unless 'speed' can literally have wings (which it clearly can't), 'with winged speed' is a metaphor.Just as before, we can clarify the structure of the sentence by extracting the Balrogs (whose nature is under question), and replacing them with more definite terms. First, imagine that the paragraph is about Eagles (which we know have wings and can fly), rather than Balrogs: there's no question that '[the Eagles] passed with winged speed over Hithlum' makes perfect sense.  To try the opposite argument, we'll replace the Eagles with something that definitely doesn't have wings and can't fly: horsemen, say.  This results in '[the horsemen] passed with winged speed over Hithlum'.  Maybe it's a little more poetic, but it clearly isn't nonsense.This is another case where the argument only serves to highlight the presumptions of its reader.  If you already believe in Balrog wings, then 'with winged speed' might well seem to refer to them, but in fact there's nothing here that demands them.Summing UpThe positive argument in favour of real Balrog wings at least has the merit of brevity.  Essentially, it is that 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) and 'with winged speed' (4) can only possibly be interpreted as literal references to actual wings.  As we've tried to show, though, there's no objective reason for drawing this conclusion.  The pro-wings interpretation works if, and only if, you already assume that Balrog wings exist.The Case Against Balrog WingsIf there's no undeniable case for Balrog wings, it's important to realize that neither is there any undeniable evidence against them.  Instead, the contrary argument is based on a range of objections: references that apparently contradict the idea of Balrog wings.  Of these, there are two particularly strong examples.Objection One: Balrogs Don't FlyThere is no point anywhere in Tolkien's work where he describes a Balrog as flying. Even in situations where it would be a huge advantage to take to the air, the Balrogs remain earthbound.  To illustrate, consider Gandalf's encounter with Durin's Bane.  This Balrog faces two obstacles, a fiery fissure, and then a chasm crossed by a narrow bridge.  These should present no problem to a winged creature, but its reaction is instructive.   [6] "Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m...and then...   "It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge..."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mLater, that same Balrog finds itself on a mountain-top, fighting for its life.  According to Gandalf's report of the incident:   [7] "I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place, and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin."   The Two Towers III 5 The White RiderIf he could fly, the Balrog could easily have saved itself.  Instead, he crashes through the air to his doom.  Durin's Bane isn't the only non-flying Balrog, either:   [8] "Many are the songs that have been sung of the duel of Glorfindel with the Balrog upon a pinnacle of rock in that high place; and both fell to ruin in the abyss."   Quenta Silmarillion 23 Of Tuor and the Fall of GondolinThe obvious question is: if Balrogs have real wings, why don't they use them?There are two counterarguments.  First, it is often suggested that 'with winged speed' (4) is a unique case where Balrogs are described as flying.  We've already considered this point - it needn't detain us here.The more common counterargument is that, in each case, the Balrogs were somehow prevented from using their wings.  According to this position, Durin's Bane leaps the fissure and steps onto the bridge not because he has no wings, but because his wings were so vast that they were cramped and unusable.  Against the two cases of Balrogs falling from mountains, it's suggested that they were exhausted from fighting, or their wings were somehow damaged. It's also sometimes put forward that Balrogs had real wings, but couldn't use them at all, or could only glide short distances rather than actually fly.  This counterargument takes many forms, but all have one feature in common - once again, it presumes that the wings must exist.There is, of course, a much simpler explanation for the Balrogs' apparent inability to fly. If we take the position that they just didn't have wings, the entire problem vanishes.Objection Two: The Question of ScaleHow big is a Balrog?  If we follow the pro-wings side of the debate, and assume that it had real wings, it's possible to come up at least some minimum figures.  This is because of the classic 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2), which means that its wingspan must be at least the width of the hall in which it was standing.  What do we know about the hall itself?   [9] "Before them was another cavernous hall.  It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept."      [10] "He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall.  The distance was greater than it had looked."      [11] "...a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet."   All from The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mThe hall is gigantic.  If the chasm is fifty feet wide (11), then the entire hall must be at least several hundred feet long.  A 'chasm' is by definition longer than it is wide, and the chasm's length defines the width of the hall.  So, we can derive a fairly reliable minimum width somewhere in the region of seventy-five to one hundred feet. This is supported by the text, which tells us that the hall was so wide that it needed pillars down the centre to support the roof:   [12] "Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars.  They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof..."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mIf the Balrog's wings were real, and literally spread 'from wall to wall' (2), its minimum wingspan is also somewhere approaching one hundred feet. This gives us a Balrog the size of a house, and remember that these are minimum values - it might be even bigger.  Many would accept this without a problem - the idea of a gigantic Balrog is quite common, and it's often depicted as being thirty feet high or more, which is consistent with these estimates.This is an important point, so we'll emphasise it. If the Balrog's wings are real, it follows necessarily that it must have been a monstrous creature with the wingspan of a small airliner.The objection this raises is quite significant: it's very hard to explain how this behemoth had lived for more than a thousand years in an underground city designed for Dwarves. As a specific example, consider the Chamber of Mazarbul, which appears just before the Company's encounter with the Balrog.  There's plenty of textual evidence about the entrance to this room.  For example:   [13] "...orcs one after another leaped into the chamber."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m(our italics)...and, a moment later, they...   [14] "...clustered in the doorway."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mThis is obviously a fairly narrow opening.  Somehow, though, the Balrog manages to follow the orcs into the Chamber through this entrance.  If a Balrog is built on the huge scale we've just discussed, it could not possibly have used this narrow entrance.The logic of this seems inescapable: we have to scale down the Balrog to get him through the door.  He can still be of 'a great height' (2) - say ten feet tall or so - but he can't realistically be much larger than this.  This idea is supported to an extent by this description from the The History of Middle-earth:   [15] "[the Balrog] strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it."   The History of Middle-earth Volume VII (The Treason of Isengard), X The Mines of Moria II: The Bridge(our italics)This is a rejected draft, so it can't be put forward as any kind of proof. It does give some insight, though, into the kind of scale that Tolkien had in mind for the Balrog.  It's also borne out by the fact that he had to 'leap' (6) across the fissure, and that he stepped onto a bridge (7) so narrow that Dwarves could only cross it in single file.  These are the actions of a more-or-less man-sized creature, not a giant.The question of scale is a serious objection to real Balrog wings.  If 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) literally refers to real wings, then the Balrog must have been gigantic.  For it to get into the Chamber of Mazarbul, though, it can't have been gigantic.  If the Balrog isn't gigantic, then 'its wings were spread from wall to wall' (2) can't refer to real wings.For the anti-wings faction, this is probably as close to a 'proof' as it's possible to get.Summing UpThese are by no means the only objections to real Balrog wings, but they're probably the strongest. Most others are circumstantial in nature and don't really advance the argument far (for example, 'imagine a creature with huge wings, spread wide, trying to handle a whirling whip of flame').The two major objections, though, are very significant.  Why don't Balrogs use their wings, if they have them?  How does a house-sized Balrog get through an orc-sized doorway?  These awkward questions only arise if Balrogs have real wings - if we assume that they don't, it's easy to escape these inconsistencies.It's probably fair to say that there is no incontrovertible evidence for real wings, and that there at least two strong objections to their existence.  Given the current state of the argument, then, the weight of evidence seems to come down pretty heavily on the 'no wings' side of the debate.  'Weight of evidence', though, isn't proof: there's always room for research and reinterpretation.Wherever the evidence lies, it's a fact that nobody knows for sure what the answer is. Only Tolkien himself could have told us, and he never made a definite statement on the topic.  It seems appropriate, then, to finish with the most definite description of a Balrog he did provide:   [16] "What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape, maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it."   The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;mFurther ReadingFrom the FAQ: Is it possible that Balrogs had wings, but couldn't fly?From the FAQ: Could Balrogs change shape?Every Time A Bell Rings A Balrog Gets Its Wings? discusses many of the same points raised here in rather more detailThe MetaEdge Study > Wings of the Balrogs is a reaction to this article

	The Dark Tower of Sauron
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	First built between c. II 1000 and c. II 1600; destroyed in II 3441; rebuilding began in III 2951; Finally destroyed in III 3019
	Location:
	On an outcrop of the Ered Lithui, in the northwest of Mordor
	Pronunciation:
	ba'rad doorrThe final 'r' should be pronounced - 'rr' is used here to emphasis this
	Meaning:
	'Dark Tower'
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	The Dark Tower, Lugb&#250;rz
	&quot;...wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant... Barad-d&#251;r, fortress of Sauron.&quot;
	The Fellowship of the Ring II 10The Breaking of the Fellowship
	The mighty shadow-shrouded stronghold of Sauron in the Second and Third Ages.The First Building of Barad-d&#251;rThe first building of Barad-d&#251;r, when Sauron was first came to Mordor, took six hundred years to complete.  Soon after, Tar-Minastir of N&#250;menor sent a fleet to Middle-earth, and Sauron's forces were driven out of the western lands that they had roamed at will to that time.  Barad-d&#251;r could not be approached by the N&#250;men&#243;reans, however, and Sauron was able to consolidate his power and extend it into the east.In II 3262, Sauron left his Dark Tower to travel to N&#250;menor with the vast forces of Ar-Pharaz&#244;n; he returned after the Downfall of N&#250;menor in II 3319.  The Last Alliance besieged Barad-d&#251;r in II 3434, and the Tower was taken and destroyed by the forces of Elendil and Gil-galad, who both perished in the siege, in II 3441.  Though Barad-d&#251;r was destroyed, its foundations were left in place.The Second Building of Barad-d&#251;rFor much of the Third Age, Sauron's stronghold was not in Mordor, which was ruled in his stead by the Nazg&#251;l.  Rather, the Dark Lord dwelt in the south of Mirkwood at Dol Guldur.  In III 2941, the White Council sent their forces to drive him from Mirkwood, and he withdrew to Mordor once again.  There, he began the rebuilding of the Dark Tower.  Given the time taken in its first building, this cannot have been fully complete at the time of the War of the Ring in III 3019.Barad-d&#251;r was constructed as much through the personal power of Sauron as through stone and mortar; when the One Ring was destroyed in Orodruin, this power was lost and the Tower destroyed forever.The Appearance of Barad-d&#251;rThe most complete description we have of Barad-d&#251;r is that given in the quote at the head of this page.  We know, then, that it was black, and constructed mainly of metal. 'Adamant' usually refers to diamond, but it is hard to imagine Sauron adding diamond towers to his dark fortress - in this context, it probably has the more general meaning of 'hard, unbreakable substance'.From the steel gate of the Tower, a causeway ran out into the plain of Gorgoroth, across a mighty bridge.  We also know that lava from Mount Doom was channeled back across that plain to Barad-d&#251;r.Tolkien probably leaves details of the Tower's construction vague intentionally, as it was hidden by a cloud of shadow and darkness at all times.  The only characters in The Lord of the Rings to actually see Barad-d&#251;r were Frodo and Sam as they journeyed to Mount Doom: '...rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of Barad-d&#251;r...' (The Lord of the Rings 6 III: Mount Doom).The 'topmost tower of Barad-d&#251;r' seems to have been the place where Sauron dwelt. At least, the Window of the Eye, from which the Lidless Eye stared out across Middle-earth, was located there.

	Barahir's father was Hador, a famously long-lived Man who ruled Gondor as its Steward for no less than one hundred and seventeen years.  According to the best sources we have, Barahir was born in the twelfth year of his father's rule, meaning that he succeeded Hador at the age of one hundred and five. Given Barahir's great age, it is not surprising that his rule, and that of his son Dior, were brief ones.Barahir held the office of Steward during the waning years of the Watchful Peace.  Both he and his son Dior, then, enjoyed rules free of troubles.  Barahir's grandson was Denethor, the son of his daughter R&#237;an, who was a young noble of just twenty at the time Barahir became Steward.  It was Denethor who was destined to rule Gondor at the time that war erupted on its borders, more than sixty years after Barahir's death.Barahir ruled as Steward for seventeen years, and was succeeded by his son Dior.

	'Barrow-wight' as used by Tolkien just means 'grave-man' or something close to this.  It is now commonly used to mean 'evil spirit', but this seems to have grown from Tolkien's own use of the term in The Lord of the Rings. The original word wight (Old English wiht) has no evil or spiritual connotations.

	The Hobbit 17 The Clouds Burst
	Since the ending of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, and the Dwarves' ultimate victory at the Battle of Nanduhirion, the orcs had nursed a hatred of that race.  In the year III 2941, the year of Bilbo Baggin's journey to the Lonely Mountain, those events lay more than one hundred and forty years in the past.  Travelling through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo, Thorin and their companions were captured by a colony of the orcs that infested those regions.  With Gandalf's help they escaped, but not before killing several of their captors, including their leader the Great Goblin.The loss of the Great Goblin at the hands of a band of Dwarves inflamed the bitter memories of the orcs' War with the Dwarves.  Under the command of Bolg, whose own father Azog had been killed at Nanduhirion, all the armies of the orcs of the Misty Mountains, and their allies the wolves and bats, began to gather and plan their revenge.Oblivious to these events, Bilbo and the Dwarves continued their journey eastward.  They achieved their quest to recover Erebor, but in doing so they earned the anger of Thranduil, and indirectly caused the destruction of Lake-town.  Thranduil's Wood-elves joined with the Lake-men, and they marched north to claim a share of Smaug's treasure in recompense.  In response, Thorin called on his cousin D&#225;in, who set out with his own army from the Iron Hills.So the scene was set for a confrontation between the Wood-elves and Lake-men on the one side, and the Dwarves of Thorin and D&#225;in on the other.  Already the first arrows had been shot when a dark cloud was seen coming out of the north - the bats that heralded the orc-armies of Bolg.  The Elves, Men and Dwarves quickly forgot their differences in the face of this new threat, and battle was joined on the slopes of Erebor and the valley beneath.  The battle was ferocious, and as it raged, it was joined by others - Eagles out of the Misty Mountains, and even Beorn himself in the shape of a monstrous bear.By nightfall the orcs were defeated, but not without great loss.  Thorin himself was slain, making a bold attack against the bodyguard of Bolg, and with him fell his young nephews F&#237;li and K&#237;li.  Bolg was dead, too, crushed by Beorn, and the goblins of the northern mountains were scattered or destroyed.
	Notes
	1
	Dates in The Hobbit are rarely given precisely, but we can be fairly sure that the battle took place in mid to late October.  We do know that Bilbo and the Dwarves arrived at the Long Lake on 22 September, and that the battle took place three or four weeks after this, in 'the last week of autumn' (The Hobbit 11 On the Doorstep - this presumably refers to the last week of October).

Battle of Fornost
	[battleoffornost.txt]
	The climactic battle after the end of the North-kingdom
	Timeline:
	Date:
	III 1975
	Location:
	Between Lake Evendim and the North Downs, to the west of Fornost1
	In the year III 1974, the kingdom of Arthedain was destroyed, and with it the last realm of the Northern D&#250;nedain.  The armies of Angmar and its allies overran the northern lands, capturing the capital of the D&#250;nedain at Fornost, and King Arvedui fled into the icy north.  It seemed at that time that the Witch-king's victory was complete.In the following year, though, the tide turned, though too late to save the remnant of the North-kingdom.  The ships of a great fleet sailed into the harbours at Mithlond, carrying a force of Gondorian warriors sent north under the command of the great general E&#228;rnur.  To that army joined the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of the Northern D&#250;nedain, and they marched east to avenge the loss of Arthedain.They met the Witch-king's armies not at Fornost itself, but on the plains westward towards Lake Evendim.  Aided by E&#228;rnur's military skill, and a force sent out of Rivendell led by Glorfindel, the armies of the D&#250;nedain and Elves had utter victory, and Angmar's armies were swept away.  After a long chase, the Witch-king himself fled into the dark of the falling night, and Glorfindel famously prophesied that he would not fall by the hand of man, as later proved true in the War of the Ring.The Battle of Fornost shaped the future history of Middle-earth in many important ways.  Its most significant effect could hardly have been guessed at the time: it robbed Gondor of its Kings.  When the Witch-king fled south, and came at last to Mordor, he did not forget his defeat at the hands of E&#228;rnur.  Many years later, E&#228;rnur became the King of Gondor, and the Witch-king challenged him to single combat.  He refused, but seven years later the challenge was made again, and this time E&#228;rnur accepted.  Riding to Minas Morgul, he was taken by the Nazg&#251;l and never heard of again.  He was the last King to rule the South-kingdom until after the War of the Ring nearly a thousand years later.
	Notes
	1
	The main battle took place on the plains between Lake Evendim and the North Downs, but later action took place elsewhere.  Retreating eastwards from the battle towards Fornost itself, the forces of Angmar were ambushed and put to rout.  From this, the Witch-king rallied what little support he could, and fled back towards Carn D&#251;m, far to the northeast.  Overtaken by the forces of E&#228;rnur and Glorfindel, he fled instead into the distant south.

	The climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, also called the Battle of Azanulbizar and the Battle of the Mines of Moria, that took place below of the East-gate of Moria in the winter of III 2799.Nine years before the battle, the Dwarf-king Thr&#243;r had been murdered by Azog the goblin in Moria.  That event triggered a furious backlash from the Dwarves, who assembled their armies and, in their quest for revenge against Azog, began the systematic destruction of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains.  Eventually, the armies of the Dwarves came up against the last stronghold of the Orcs, and hiding place of Azog, old Moria itself.The battle was fought in the valley of Nanduhirion beneath Moria's gates.  The Orcs were more numerous, and held the higher ground at the head of the valley.  The Dwarves under Thr&#225;in II, though, were better equipped, and were rallied late in the battle by the arrival of reinforcements, commanded by Thr&#225;in's cousin N&#225;in.  There was great loss on both sides, but eventually the Dwarves had the victory; D&#225;in Ironfoot - just thirty-two years old at the time - slew Azog on the steps of Moria.

	&nbsp;&#149; Wainriders
	At the end of the second millennium of the Third Age, the realm of Gondor came close to its destruction.  The Wainrider people from the east made an alliance with the Haradrim, and a dual attack on Ithilien was launched.  While the Wainriders assaulted Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the Poros and invaded South Ithilien.The northern assault of the Wainriders was met by the King of Gondor himself, Ondoher, with his two sons Artamir and Faramir.  The Easterlings swept through Gondor's defence, cutting down the King and his heirs and routing his army.  Their victory complete, and Gondor defenceless before them, the Wainriders paused in North Ithilien to celebrate their conquest.Unknown to the victorious Wainriders, their allies in the south had met with much less success. Beyond hope, the Gondorian Captain E&#228;rnil had led Gondor's Southern Army to victory over the Haradrim, destroying their army in South Ithilien, to the north of the Poros.  Then E&#228;rnil turned north.The feasting Wainriders suddenly found their success reversed, as E&#228;rnil appeared with his Southern Army, reinforced by fleeing members of Ondoher's defeated northern troops.  E&#228;rnil's army descended on the unprepared Wainriders, driving many of them into the swamplands of the Dead Marshes.  That eastern people, for so long a dreaded enemy of Gondor, never challenged her again, and the battle where E&#228;rnil won his success was named after the Wainrider camp where it had taken place: the Battle of the Camp.

	In the time of Steward Cirion, Gondor suffered invasion by a fierce eastern people known only as the Balchoth.  In desperation, Cirion sent north for aid to the Northmen who dwelt at the sources of the Anduin, the &#201;oth&#233;od. Beyond Cirion's hope, their lord Eorl led them south, and defeated Gondor's enemies in the place on the banks of the Great River known as the Field of Celebrant.  It was Eorl's victory in that battle that led directly to the founding of the land Rohan, and so the Battle was commemorated by a tapestry hanging in the the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

	Meaning:
	Not certainly known.1
	The great ocean inlet to the south of Beleriand, in which lay the Isle of Balar, and into which the River Sirion flowed.The Bay was formed in the cataclysms that accompanied the Battle of the Powers, long before the First Age, and was said to have been the greatest bay of the sea on the shores of Middle-earth.  On its northern coasts lay Arvernien and the Mouths of Sirion, where the Exiles of Gondolin dwelt in the last years of the First Age, and from where E&#228;rendil set out on his voyage to the Undying Lands.  Its eastern coastlands were dominated by the great unpeopled forests of Taur-im-Duinath.Far out in the Bay lay the Isle of Balar, where C&#237;rdan the Shipwright dwelt with his people after the loss of the Havens of the Falas.  There was great friendship between C&#237;rdan and the Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion, and in the late First Age, the Bay must have seen much traffic between the Isle and the Mouths.Just as it had been created out the tumults of a war of the Powers, the Bay was destroyed, with the rest of Beleriand, in the War of Wrath between the Valar and Morgoth at the end of the First Age.

	The second King of Arthedain, who inherited the throne from his father Amlaith of Fornost, the founder of that Kingdom.  His name means 'great' or 'large', which may be a reference to his stature (although he may simply be named for the famous Elf of the First Age who shared this name, Beleg Strongbow).Beleg's reign saw two events that would have a huge impact on Middle-earth's history, but whose importance wasn't fully recognized at the time.  The first of these was the arrival across the Misty Mountains of a strange race of beings: similar to Men, but far shorter and with hairy, bootless feet.  The D&#250;nedain called them periannath, 'halflings', and they were the first Hobbits to enter the western lands.The second historic event was the descent of a strange shadow on Greenwood the Great.  This was wholly mysterious at first, but before the end of Beleg's reign, the Wise had discovered that its source was at Dol Guldur in the southern part of the Forest, whose name came to be changed to Mirkwood in these times.  It was not discovered until long after Beleg's time that his reign had seen the return of Sauron himself, the first move in a game that would end in the War of the Ring nearly two thousand years in the future.Beleg ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Mallor.

	Notes
	1
	In the twelfth volume of the The History of Middle-earth, The Peoples of Middle-earth, an essay appears entitled Of Dwarves and Men which sheds some light on the people of Belegost.  Circumstantial evidence given there suggests that the Dwarves of Belegost were unrelated to Durin's Folk, the Longbeards that appear in Tolkien's better-known work, and instead belonged to a different clan, either the Firebeards or the Broadbeams.  The word-order used there suggests that Belegost was founded by the Broadbeams, while nearby Nogrod was populated by the Firebeard clan.

	Bounded to the north and east by mountain chains, and to the south and west by the Great Sea, Beleriand and the lands to the north were the setting for much of the Silmarillion.  Originally, the name 'Beleriand' applied only to the country around the Bay of Balar, but as time passed the name came to be given to the entire land.  In the final battle that saw the ultimate defeat of Morgoth, Beleriand was broken and destroyed - only parts of Ossiriand in the east remained, to be renamed Lindon in later ages.

Beorn

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Thrived around III 2941; died some time before III 30181
	Race:
	Men2
	Culture:
	Founder of the Beornings
	Meaning:
	'warrior' and 'bear'3
	BEORNGrimbeorn the Old
	The skin-changer who dwelt in the Vales of Anduin near the western eaves of Mirkwood, who could take the form of a Man or a huge black bear.  He played a great part in the victory over the Goblins at the Battle of Five Armies.
	Notes
	1
	Tolkien makes it clear in his letters that Beorn's lifespan was no greater than that of an ordinary Man. It's very unlikely, then, that he survived much beyond III 3000. (see The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 144, dated 1954).
	2
	In the same letter referred to in Note 1, Tolkien explains that despite his remarkable abilities, Beorn definitely belonged to the race of Men: 'Though a skin-changer and no doubt a bit of a magician, Beorn was a Man'.
	3
	The etymology of Beorn's name is interesting.  The Old English word originally meant 'bear', but evolved over the centuries to the point where it came to mean 'warrior'.  So, Beorn's ability to transform from a bear to a man echoes the linguistic development of his name.The original meaning of Beorn relates to the bear's love of honey, and contains b&#233;o, meaning 'bee'.  This also appears in the name Beowulf: like Beorn, this means 'bear', but is literally 'bee-wolf'.  This bee connection explains the references in The Hobbit to Beorn's bee-pastures and huge bees: 'The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold' (The Hobbit 7, Queer Lodgings).

	Bungo BagginsBelladonna TookBILBO BAGGINS
	Head of the Baggins family, he dwelt alone at Bag End, Hobbiton, until Gandalf involved him in the Quest of Erebor in 2941 (Third Age), and so drew the Hobbits into the great affairs of the end of the Third Age.  During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo came upon the One Ring in an orc-hold of the Misty Mountains.Bilbo's records of his travels, and those of his heir Frodo, were compiled into the Red Book of Westmarch, and became the basis of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.Life in the ShireIII 2890 - III 2941The only son of the wealthy and respectable Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took, Bilbo grew up at Bag End, which his father had excavated in Hobbiton Hill.  He seems to have visited his mother's family at Great Smials, for he remembered Gandalf's firework displays there.Bilbo's father Bungo died in 2926, and his mother Belladonna in 2934, after which Bilbo lived alone at Bag End for seven years until a fateful morning in the spring of 2941, when his pleasant, uneventful life was disturbed by the arrival of Gandalf.Bilbo and the Quest of EreborIII 2941More than a hundred and fifty years before Gandalf disturbed Bilbo in his garden that spring morning, the dragon Smaug had descended in flame on Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, an ancient kingdom of the Dwarves far to the east of the Shire.  Those Dwarves that survived scattered throughout the northern lands, and many, led by Thorin, the rightful heir to the kingdom, travelled into the west and settled in the Blue Mountains near the borders of the Shire.  Now, with Gandalf's aid, Thorin had begun to plot his revenge on Smaug.Gandalf convinced Thorin that a Hobbit should accompany his party, both because of the Hobbits' natural stealth, and because he wanted to involve them in the wider world, as a preparation against the coming darkness.  He chose Bilbo largely because of his Took inheritance, but he later suggested that Bilbo might in some sense have been 'fated' to go on the Quest.So it was that on an evening at the end of April1 2941, Gandalf returned to Bilbo's house with Thorin and his twelve companions, and the Quest of Erebor was begun.
	Notes
	1
	In Chapter 2 of The Hobbit (Roast Mutton), Bilbo and the Dwarves set out 'one fine morning just before May' (our italics).  However, when Bilbo looks back on their departure while travelling through Mirkwood (Chapter 8, Flies and Spiders), he remembers that they 'started their journey that May morning long ago.'  Perhaps the rigours of his long journey had affected Bilbo's memory!

Its maker Celebrimbor sent it originally to King Gil-galad in Lindon, but Gil-galad passed it on to Elrond to aid the founding of Rivendell.  At the end of the Third Age, Elrond had borne the Blue Ring for nearly five thousand years.

Book of Mazarbul
	[bookofmazarbul.txt]
	The history of the Balin in Moria
	The record of Balin's return to Moria with a group of Longbeard Dwarves in III 2989.  It recounted a battle with the Orcs that inhabited the old halls of Khazad-d&#251;m, in which Balin's Dwarves were victorious.  They settled in the Twenty-first Hall, above the East-gate, and Balin himself ruled his new domain from the old Chamber of Records, also called the Chamber of Mazarbul.  Over the next five years, the Dwarves seem to have settled quite succesfully into their new home, exploring under the Mountains as far as the West-gate, and recovering Durin's Axe and apparently other priceless items made of mithril.
	The Lordship of Balin was short-lived.  Ori, who was with him in Moria, recorded in the last pages of the Book how an army of Orcs came unexpectedly out of the east, slaying Balin outside the East-gate.  The Dwarves defended themselves, but they were beleaguered from the the east by the Orcs, and from the west by the mysterious Watcher in the Water.  Their last stand was in Balin's Chamber of Mazarbul, where the Orcs eventually overcame and destroyed them.
	The victorious Orcs seem not to have understood the significance of the Book, so that rather than carrying it off or destroying it, they left it to rot in the Chamber.  There it was found twenty-four years later by the Company of the Ring, burned, slashed and blood-stained, but still readable in some parts.  Gandalf passed it to Gimli to return to King D&#225;in, after which we hear no more about it.  If Gimli was able to keep it through the battles that followed, and didn't discard it with his gear at Parth Galen, it is possible that he carried it throughout his travels in Middle-earth, returning it at last to D&#225;in's heir Thorin III in Erebor.

	The Boromir who travelled with the Company of the Ring was not the first noble of Gondor to bear that name. More than five hundred years before the War of the Ring, his ancient ancestor, the son of Steward Denethor I, had borne it before him.Like the Boromir of The Lord of the Rings, the ancient Boromir was also a powerful warrior.  It was while his father ruled Gondor that the race of the Uruk-hai first appeared, and Osgiliath was attacked and invaded.  Boromir went to war and drove the enemy back from Ithilien for a while, but he sustained poisoned wounds in that war.Boromir's Morgul-wounds wracked him with pain and shortened his life.  He lived only seventy-nine years, a fraction of the usual lifespan for one of his line.  When he succeeded his father, his Stewardship was to last no more than twelve years, but it paved the way for the historic rule of his famous and illustrious son Cirion.Boromir ruled Gondor for twelve years, and was succeeded by his son Cirion.

	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Hobbits of Bree
	The Hobbits native to Bree and the lands around; their interaction with Men (who also lived in the Bree-land), made them more open to the outside world than their parochial cousins in the Shire.Bree itself was a very ancient township of Men.  The first Hobbits came there from the east in about the year 1300 of the Third Age, making Bree the only place in the world where Hobbits and Men lived together side by side.  Most of the Hobbits of the Bree-land lived in Staddle, a village on the southeastern slopes of the Bree-hill, but some also dwelt in Bree itself, living on the hill above the houses of Men.It was three hundred years after Hobbits first arrived in Bree that two Fallohides, Marcho and Blanco, led a group of colonists westward to found the Shire.  The Bree-hobbits, therefore, tended to look down somewhat on their cousins in the Shire, referring to them as 'Colonists' and 'Outsiders'.  The Hobbits of Bree claimed to have originated most Hobbit customs, and certainly it was thought that they were the ones who first discovered the properties of pipe-weed.At the end of the Third Age, the Bree-hobbits still occasionally travelled west to the Shire, but they rarely ventured further than Buckland or the Eastfarthing, those parts of the Shire that were closest to their home.In The Lord of the Rings I 9; At the Sign of the Prancing Pony, Tolkien gives us a list of the more prominent Hobbit families living in the Bree-land at the time of the War of the Ring; Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Mugwort, Sandheaver, Tunnelly and Underhill.  There were also hobbits by the name of Banks living in the Shire, and Underhill was a hamlet of Hobbiton, but we can do no more than speculate on the links between these families and regions.

	In the Bree-land, Men and Hobbits lived peaceably side by side.  These two races, identified individually as the Bree-hobbits and the Bree-men (or less formally as the Big Folk and the Little Folk) were collectively described as the Bree-landers.  They lived in four communities scattered around the Bree-hill: Bree itself, Staddle, Combe and Archet.
	They were a generally friendly folk, at least until the upheavals brought about by the War of the Ring.  They had some dealings with the Shire-hobbits, though the road between Bree and their ancient 'colony' of the Shire was less travelled in the late Third Age than it had once been.  The Bree-landers maintained their own dialect and customs, including their own unique calendar.

	Brytta's reign was not a peaceful one.  Though the Dunlendings that had troubled his immediate ancestors had been quelled, a new threat arose.  In the Northlands, the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was raging, and many of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were fleeing southwards, seeking to settle in the White Mountains south of Rohan.  Brytta hunted them down, and by the time of his death it was thought that the Mark had been cleared of them.
	Brytta ruled Rohan for forty-four years, and was succeeded by his son Walda.

	Flourished III 1979 (379 by the Shire-reckoning)
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Family:
	Said to be the founder of the Oldbuck family
	Meaning:
	Almost certainly Old English: 'buck', meaning a male deer or goat1
	Title:
	Thain of the Shire
	BUCCAThe Oldbuck FamilyThe Brandybuck Family
	The end of the second millennium of the Third Age was a time of crisis for the Hobbits of the Shire.  The northern lands of Middle-earth were aflame with war. The armies of Angmar, of Arthedain, of Cardolan, Rhudaur and latterly Gondor marched across the lands that had been the northern realm of Arnor.  Most of the Shire-hobbits went into hiding, though some few marched to the service of Arthedain, within whose borders the Shire lay, but they never returned.At last, peace returned: the kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain fell one by one, and then the victorious Witch-king of Angmar was himself defeated by a revenging army of Gondor. The Hobbits returned to their old lives, but the loss of Arvedui, the last king of Arthedain, left them leaderless.After four years had passed since the end of the great wars, the Hobbits decided to take a leader for themselves.  They chose2 one Bucca of the Marish, who was granted the title Thain of the Shire, and led the Shire-hobbits to peace and prosperity.No more is known of Bucca's life, but his legacy remained until the time of the War of the Ring and beyond.  At that time, more than twelve hundred years after his Thainship, the Masters of Buckland still proudly claimed descent from Bucca the first Thain.
	Notes
	1
	'Bucca' isn't a fictional name: it was fairly common among the Anglo-Saxons, with the same meaning as given above.  (For example, modern Buckingham comes from Anglo-Saxon for 'Land of Bucca's People'.)  That, and the fact that this word evolved into 'buck' in reality just as in the Shire, point strongly to this being the correct interpretation.It should be noted, though, there are at least two other possibilities.  The first is 'charter', from a word that evolved into modern 'book', and quite appropriate to the first Thain of the Shire. There may also just possibly be a connection with a much older word, p&#250;ka, meaning a sprite or goblin, though this seems far less likely.
	2
	In the drafts of The Lord of the Rings Appendices, it is stated that Bucca was officially elected to his post, but this statement doesn't appear in the published work. (See The History of Middle-earth, volume 12, VIII The Tale of Years of the Third Age, 1976)

	The Eastmarch of the Shire
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Founded in III 2340
	Location:
	East of the Shire, across the River Brandywine
	Origins and HistorySeven hundred and forty years after the founding of the Shire, Gorhendad Oldbuck crossed the River Brandywine from the Eastfarthing and started the building of Brandy Hall in Buck Hill, in a land hitherto unpopulated by hobbits.  As Gorhendad's family grew, the Hall also expanded, and soon there was a flourishing community in the land between the River and the Old Forest.From that time, Buckland was ruled by the Brandybucks, as Gorhendad renamed his family, who were given the title 'Masters of Buckland'.The village of Bucklebury, lying close by Buck Hill, was considered Buckland's chief village, but the expanding population meant that many other villages soon grew up in the region, the largest of which were Newbury, Crickhollow and Standelf.  The growing power of the Master of Buckland gained respect from those close by in the Eastfarthing, too; the lands of the Marish between Stock and Rushey also acknowledged themselves under the sway of Buck Hall.The Bucklanders soon found themselves threatened by the strange trees of the Forest, and so built a vast hedge, the High Hay, stretching twenty miles along the eastern border of their land.  This was not the only danger to threaten Buckland - in 2911 (Third Age), the year of the Fell Winter, the Brandywine froze and Buckland was invaded by white wolves.Buckland was also the childhood home of Frodo Baggins, who returned here on his journey to Rivendell in 3018 (Third Age).  He bought a house in Crickhollow, and claimed that he would be living there, but instead entered the Old Forest through the old Hay Gate, and left the Eastmarch of the Shire.CultureAlthough similar in many ways to other hobbits, the Bucklanders did have certain peculiarities. Due no doubt in part to the Fallohidish blood of the Brandybucks, the hobbits of Buckland were somewhat more adventurous than their cousins in the Shire (while still conservative by the measure of many other races in Middle-earth).  They enjoyed boating, an activity frowned upon by Shire-hobbits, and some of them could even swim.When the Bree-folk ventured to the Shire, Buckland was their usual destination (though some ventured as far as the Eastfarthing), and so was rather more cosmopolitan (in hobbit terms) than the rest of the land.Living under constant danger from the Old Forest, the Bucklanders were hardier and more suspicious than the usual Shire-hobbit.  They were organised to deal with danger (through the famous Horn-call of Buckland), and they kept their doors locked at night, which was unusual in the Shire.

	The Hobbits of Buckland
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Buckland founded in III 2340 (740 by the Shire-reckoning)
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Division:
	Various, but largely descended from the Fallohides
	The inhabitants of Buckland on the eastern borders of the Shire, the Bucklanders acknowledged the Master of Buckland as their leader.  The Brandybucks, descendants of Gorhendad Oldbuck who founded Buckland, were considered the most important family of the Bucklanders.The Brandybucks had a strong Fallohidish strain in their blood, it is said, and this made them more adventurous than many of their more conservative neighbours in the Shire.  They did not share the Shire-hobbits' fear of water, for example, and the Bucklanders' boats where often seen on the Brandywine River that bordered their land.On the eastern border of Buckland lay the dangerous Old Forest, and the constant threat of the dark trees made the Bucklanders somewhat hardier than typical hobbits.

Butterflies
	[butterflies.txt]
	Where the River Narog flowed into Sirion, there was a lush valley filled with willow trees, a place understandably known as the Land of Willows, or Nan-tathren in Elvish.  According to the legends of the Lost Tales, this was the place were butterflies of all kinds came into the world, and they remained common there during the First Age.  In Tolkien's better known works, though butterflies are mentioned several times, they are only actually seen on one occasion: Bilbo finds them fluttering above the treetops of Mirkwood in The Hobbit.  Like other creatures that lived in that dark wood, its butterflies had turned completely black in colour, and so that variety is referred to as the 'black emperor'.
	The Quenya word for 'butterfly' was wilwarin, a name the Elves also gave to a constellation of stars.  The identity of this constellation is not completely certain, but Christopher Tolkien suggests that the northern 'W'-shaped group of stars that we know as Cassiopeia was the Elvish constellation of the Butterfly.

	A large river-island in the Anduin, to the east of the land of An&#243;rien.  It was held in defence against Mordor by Gondor to prevent crossings of the Great River, though these defences were breached during the War of the Ring.The island itself was long and narrow, a little over ten miles in length.  At its northern end, sharp rocks split the waters of the Anduin in a bubbling foam that gave the island its name.  Cair Andros was covered with trees for much of its length.Strategically, the island was of immense importance: apart from the bridge at Osgiliath, it was the only practical means for an army from the east to cross the Anduin into Gondor's heartlands.  The Gondorians took this risk seriously.  Amon D&#238;n, the first of the Beacon-hills, was set up originally to warn the citizens of Minas Tirith if Cair Andros was ever breached.Gondor took steps to fortify the island, too, but the history of these fortifications is difficult to establish.  We know that it was 'manned' at the time of King Ondoher's fall in III 1944, but whatever defences were in place at that time were apparently abandoned, since Denethor's great-grandfather T&#250;rin II found it necessary to fortify the island again in about the year III 2900.The Gondorian defences fell on 10 March III 3019.  On the same day that the Witch-king rode from Minas Morgul with the armies that would besiege Minas Tirith, Sauron released a smaller force (though still numbering more than 6,000 Orcs and Men) from the Morannon.  They overwhelmed the defenders of Cair Andros, and used the island to cross into An&#243;rien.  It was this northern force that blocked the eastward progress of the Rohirrim as they rode to Gondor's aid, though after the Battle of the Pelennor, the Rohirrim chased them down and pushed them back out of An&#243;rien.They retreated to Cair Andros, and apparently held the island for some days. In his march on Mordor, Aragorn released a small group of soldiers from his main army to retake the island if necessary, and hold it.  They must have succeeded, since the last we hear of the island of Cair Andros, its moorings were used by the ships of Gondor, as glimpsed by Frodo after completing his Quest.

Calenhad
	[calenhad.txt]
	Sixth of the Beacons of Gondor
	Some miles to the east of the Firien Wood, there was a wide, shallow recess in the foothills of the White Mountains.  Overlooking this region were two of the Beacon-hills of Gondor, Min-Rimmon to the east and Calenhad to the west.  Calenhad was the sixth of the seven beacons, within sight of the last of the beacons on the Halifirien, above the borders of Rohan.
	Tolkien never gives us the meaning of the name Calenhad directly, but it seems to come from Elvish root-words meaning something like 'green mound'.  The name may be connected with Calenardhon, the ancient Gondorian name for the land later known as Rohan, whose borders lay just a few miles from the feet of the hill.

	Soon after his accession to Gondor's throne, King Ondoher realized that his kingdom's northern enemies, the Wainriders, had made an alliance with her old southern foe, the Haradrim.  To counter this double threat, Ondoher divided Gondor's army into two parts; a larger Northern Army and a smaller Southern Army.  The Northern Army he led himself; the Captaincy of the Southern Army he gave to his distant cousin E&#228;rnil.As Ondoher had foreseen, the Wainriders and Haradrim launched a joint attack on Gondor, in the year III 1944, and Gondor's two Armies marched through Ithilien to the defence of the South-kingdom.  Ondoher's northern force was all but destroyed by the Wainriders, but E&#228;rnil led his lesser Army to a great victory over the Haradrim.  Turning north, the Southern Army reunited with the remnant of the Northern, and together they fell on the Wainriders at the Battle of the Camp.  E&#228;rnil's victories as the Southern Army's Captain would ultimately earn him the Kingship of Gondor itself.

	Notes
	1
	If you thought this mountain's name was pronounced 'Caradras', you're in good company - even the BBC got this pronunciation wrong in their classic radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.The confusion arises because modern English uses the combination 'th' to refer to two different sounds: the 'voiceless' sound in 'both', and the 'voiced' sound in 'bother'.  In Elvish, these two sounds were represented by different characters - typically th&#250;le () and anto () respectively. Tolkien adopts a consistent transliteration scheme for these Elvish characters: he uses 'th' to refer exclusively to the voiceless sound, and 'dh' to the voiced.'Caradhras' is probably the most prominent use of this 'dh' sound, but it does occur fairly frequently in other names: Aredhel, Maedhros and Caras Galadhon are three important examples.

Carn D&#251;m

	Location:

	Pronunciation:
	Probably 'karn doom'
	Meaning:
	Debatable1
	Peak in the far north of the Misty Mountains, the site of the ancient capital of the Witch-king of Angmar.
	Notes
	1
	Carn D&#251;m is very difficult to translate.  Indeed, not only is there no attested meaning of the name, but we can't even be sure of the language it comes from!  There are at least four possibilities.The most obvious relies on the Elvish word car(a)n, meaning 'red'.  From this, many have assumed that the entire name is Elvish, and presumably Sindarin.  In support of this, the name Angmar, for the land where Carn D&#251;m stood, seems to be definitely Sindarin. On the other hand, there is no known connection between Carn D&#251;m and the colour red, and - a serious difficulty - d&#251;m is almost certainly not an Elvish word.D&#251;m isn't Elvish, but it is one of the very few words of Dwarvish vocabulary that we know for certain.  In Khazad-d&#251;m, it means 'halls, mansions', and this fits neatly for a mountain fortress or citadel. What's more, nearby Mount Gundabad has Dwarvish associations, so the possibility arises that Carn D&#251;m might have once been a city of the Dwarves, named in their language.  There's no direct evidence to back this up, though, and carn doesn't seem to be a Dwarvish word.The possibility that Carn D&#251;m comes from the Black Speech must also be considered, but we simply do not have sufficient information on this language to make a useful judgement.A final possibility is that Carn D&#251;m comes from a Mannish language.  Tolkien used real languages to represent the Mannish languages in his books, and especially Old English and Old Norse.  Carn D&#251;m doesn't seem to belong to either of these, but there is another candidate: carn d&#250;m are words from Gaelic that can be translated 'mountain fortress'.  Did Tolkien intend this, or is it a spectacular coincidence? To accept it as intentional, we'd need to assume an entire new 'Angmarian' language, based on Gaelic, that was wiped out with Angmar by the Gondorians and survived only in this one name.  This seems unlikely in the extreme, but where Tolkien is concerned, anything is possible...

River Carnen

Its winding course took it southwards for more than two hundred miles, until its waters emptied into the Celduin (the River Running) and were carried on southwards to the Sea of Rh&#251;n.The river's name, Carnen, is a direct Elvish equivalent of its Mannish name, the Redwater.  Both are very likely a reference to its source in the Iron Hills, since rivers whose sources lie among iron deposits have water with a very distinctive red-orange colour.

	Dates:
	The only recorded encounter with a cave-troll was on 15 January III 30191
	Race:
	Trolls
	Meaning:
	'Troll' is a word from Scandinavian myth, used as an English translation of the Sindarin torog, of uncertain derivation
	A race of monstrous creatures found in caverns and dark places.  They are known from an encounter with the Fellowship of the Ring as they passed through Moria, but were evidently found elsewhere in Middle-earth, too.  These trolls, along with orcs and perhaps other creatures, were originally sent to inhabit Moria by Sauron some five hundred years before the War of the Ring.
	The cave-trolls of Moria were of huge size with a skin of dark green scales, and flat, toeless feet.  The fact that Gandalf was able to recognise the creature he encountered in Moria specifically as a cave-troll strongly suggests that this appearance was shared by others of the kind.
	Notes
	1
	The only definite mention Tolkien makes of a cave-troll is during the Fellowship's struggle to escape Moria on this date.  It's fair to presume, though, that the cave-trolls originated with the others of their kind, probably even before the beginning of the First Age.

	Celeborn remained in Middle-earth when Galadriel sailed into the West at the end of the Third Age.  He remained for some time in L&#243;rien, alone, and then retired to Rivendell, where Elrond's sons still dwelt.  This is the last we hear of him.

	Notes
	1
	III 109 is the date of Celebr&#237;an's wedding to Elrond, so she must clearly have been alive for some time before this.  One source (Unfinished Tales III 4, The History of Galadriel and Celeborn) mentions her as early as 1350 (Second Age), as shown in the timeline above. The text in question (Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn) is, however, a manuscript that was very considerably revised by Tolkien. We cannot therefore be sure that this very early date was intended to stand.

	There is no specific record of Celebrimbor's date of birth.  He is first mentioned late in the First Age dwelling in Nargothrond with his father Curufin.  It's impossible to know how old he was at this time, but the fact that there is no account of him before this, and especially that he wasn't present to swear the Oath of F&#235;anor, suggests that he was born after the Noldor returned to Middle-earth.

A wooden bridge crossed the Celebros at a place called - because of the waterfalls' spray - Dimrost, or the Rainy Stair.Dimrost's name was changed when Nienor came to cross the Celebros.  When she reached the bridge, which gave a wide view of the Ravines of Teiglin to the south and west, a foresight of her doom seems to have come upon her (she was to die in the waters of the Teiglin).  The sudden shuddering that overtook her then gave a new name to the crossing of the Celebros: Nen Girith, the Shuddering Water.

	Celegorm the Fair was the third of the seven sons of F&#235;anor.  The most ambitious of the seven, he followed the oath of his father with the greatest ardour, and this led him to his destruction.In Valinor, Celegorm became a great hunter, and had the friendship of Orom&#235;, often hunting with the Vala or visiting his house.  From Orom&#235;, Celegorm gained great knowledge of birds and beasts, and he learned to understand their tongues, and he gained also another gift, Huan the great hound.  He also had great friendship with his cousin Aredhel, the daughter of Fingolfin.After the Darkening of Valinor, he stood in the court of Tirion with his father and his six brothers, and swore to the Oath of F&#235;anor.  With that, he marched with the Noldor from Valinor and returned to Middle-earth as the Moon rose for the first time.  The faithful hound Huan accompanied Celegorm into exile.Early Years in Beleriand, I 1 - I 455In the first assault of the Noldor on the Orcs, the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, Celegorm found himself in the hills around Eithel Sirion, in the north of the Ered Wethrin.  Receiving news of an orc-host coming north from the Falas, he ambushed them and drove them into the Fen of Serech.After the battle, in which his father F&#235;anor died, he journeyed to the land of Himlad in the eastern regions of Beleriand, and there took up his abode with his younger brother Curufin.  Celegorm and Curufin together claimed the land between the rivers Aros and Celon, and they fortified the Pass of Aglon in the north against the forces of Morgoth.  During this time, the two were close in friendship with their brother Caranthir, who dwelt across the valley of the river Gelion in the land of Thargelion, and often went hunting with him.The land of Himlad was held for more than 450 years by Celegorm and his brother, but in the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth's armies broke the defence of the Pass of Aglon, and overran Celegorm's lands.  With his brother Curufin, he was forced to flee, and they journeyed south and west until they came to Finrod's halls in Nargothrond.Time in Nargothrond, I 455 - c. I 465Finrod received his cousins warmly, and for a time Celegorm and Curufin dwelt happily in Nargothrond, hunting the orcs and wolves that dared to cross the Guarded Plain.  They were at that time mighty lords, and their power and influence in Finrod's domain grew.Before many years had passed, though, Beren came out of Doriath seeking Finrod's help in his quest for the Silmaril.  The Oath of F&#235;anor bound Celegorm to defy any that sought a Silmaril, but Finrod was also bound by an oath, to Beren's father Barahir, to lend aid in the quest, and so he departed from Nargothrond, leaving it in the keeping of his brother Orodreth.  Celegorm and Curufin exercised their influence after the departure of Finrod, however, and during this time they were effectively the rulers of Nargothrond.While out hunting on the Guarded Plain, they discovered L&#250;thien, who having escaped from her father in Doriath was seeking for Beren.  Celegorm saw that to be wedded to the daughter of one of the greatest kings in Beleriand would be a great source of power, and so he tricked L&#250;thien into returning to Nargothrond with him.  Once there, he imprisoned her and sent false messages to Thingol, pursuing his suit.From L&#250;thien, they learned that Beren and Finrod had been captured by Sauron and imprisoned in his fortress at Tol-in-Gaurhoth.  They made no attempt to rescue them, believing that the death of Finrod would further their own power in Nargothrond. Celegorm's hound, Huan, disobeyed his master, and help L&#250;thien to escape from the brothers, leading here away into the north after Beren.Though he later returned to Celegorm, their trust was diminished.  While he was away from Nargothrond, Huan had aided in the defeat of Sauron in the north, and the destruction of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.  Many prisoners of Sauron, who were released when his tower was destroyed, returned to Nargothrond and reported the fate of Finrod.  So the lies that Celegorm and Curufin had told in pursuance of power were exposed, and the people turned back to their rightful king, Orodreth.  Celegorm and Curufin were exiled from Nargothrond, but their deeds were repudiated by their people, who had come with them from Himlad, and so they journeyed friendless in Beleriand.Return to the Northern Lands, c. I 465 - c. I 500After their expulsion from Nargothrond, the brothers journeyed to the north and east, seeking again the lands where they had once ruled, and especially Himring, where their elder brother Maedhros was still lord.As they travelled beside the eaves of Brethil, they discovered Beren and L&#250;thien returning from the north, and attacked them.  In defence of L&#250;thien, Huan the hound deserted Celegorm and fought against him.  Curufin lost his horse in that fight, and the brothers were forced to ride away eastwards together on Celegorm's steed.  Journeying on through Dimbar and Nan Dungortheb, they came at last to the lands of Maedhros.Celegorm was not to abide there long, for only a few years after their arrival, Maedhros united the Elves of Beleriand, and the great battle known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad took place. Celegorm marched into the north with his brothers, and was wounded in the battle, but Uldor the Accursed betrayed the Elves and turned against them, and so the host of Maedhros was broken and scattered.  Celegorm fled with his brothers to the lands below Mount Dolmed, in the far east of Beleriand.There they dwelt, a broken and wandering people, for some thirty years.  In that time, Beren and L&#250;thien dwelt in the far south, on the island of Tol Galen in the River Adurant, and with them was the Silmaril that they had recovered from Morgoth's crown.  While their oath bound the brothers to recover the jewel, none dared assail that hallowed island, and so they waited.Eventually, Beren and L&#250;thien passed away, and the Silmaril was taken to Dior, Thingol's heir, in Doriath.  Now the sons of F&#235;anor sent demands to Dior for the return of the jewel, but Dior disregarded them.  So the brothers formed an army and assaulted the halls of Menegroth, and there Celegorm was slain by Dior, though Dior also perished, as did Curufin and Caranthir.

	The literal meaning of his name seems to have been 'swift-hasty', but its temporary change to Celegorn and back may suggest that Tolkien did not intend to keep this meaning. (The History of Middle-earth Volume 5, The Lost Road and Other Writings III The Etymologies).

During his own reign, though, their numbers increased as the growing darkness in Mirkwood drove them westward out of Rhovanion.  Fallohides and Stoors crossed the Misty Mountains at this time, joining the Harfoots who had been living in the west for a century or more.Celepharn ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Celebrindor.

	The errand-rider of Erkenbrand
	After the loss of the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, Erkenbrand withdrew his Riders to Helm's Deep, and sent Ceorl south as a messenger to warn &#201;omer.  He was surprised to come across Th&#233;oden's army riding north, ready to launch their own defence of the Fords.  The news brought by Ceorl caused Th&#233;oden to reconsider his strategy, and he rode instead to join Erkenbrand at Helm's Deep, so setting the stage for the mighty Battle of the Hornburg.
	Like other Rohirrim, Ceorl's name comes from Old English.  It refers to a particular rank in Anglo-Saxon society, in fact the lowest rank possible while remaining a freeman.  Historically, these people would not normally have been professional soldiers, so if Ceorl's background follows his name, we might guess that he was a farmer or tradesman who had been pressed into military service to help deal with the imminent threat to Rohan.

	The title taken by the Heirs of Isildur after the loss of the kingdom of Arthedain; sixteen lords of Men, from Aranarth (elder son of Arvedui, last King of Arthedain) to Aragorn II Elessar.    I Aranarth  (Chieftain for 131 years to III 2106) The heir of Arvedui, who would have become King of Arthedain if not for the destruction of his realm by the Witch-king. He saw his loss avenged, though, when a great army of D&#250;nedain out of Gondor, led by E&#228;rnur, wiped out the Witch-king's own realm of Angmar. During his time, the Watchful Peace began, and the Heirs of Isildur had peace until the time of Arahad I.     II Arahael  (Chieftain for 71 years to III 2177)     III Aranuir  (Chieftain for 70 years to III 2247)     IV Aravir  (Chieftain for 72 years to III 2319)     V Aragorn I  (Chieftain for 8 years to III 2327) The first Aragorn, after whom Aragorn of the War of the Ring was named, lost his life in eastern Eriador, where he was slain by wolves.     VI Araglas  (Chieftain for 128 years to III 2455)     VII Arahad I  (Chieftain for 68 years to III 2523) In his time, the evil that had once dwelt in Dol Guldur returned, and the Watchful Peace came to an end. In the eighth year of his reign, the White Council was formed, a matter that Arahad must surely have been aware of, if he was not directly involved himself. As the years drew on, the extent of the danger from the east became more evident; the Misty Mountains were filled with Orcs, and near the end of Arahad's time as Chieftain, Celebr&#237;an the wife of Elrond was captured and tortured by them.     VIII Aragost  (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2588)     IX Aravorn  (Chieftain for 66 years to III 2654)     X Arahad II  (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2719)     XI Arassuil  (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2784) Arassuil saw Eriador openly invaded by Orcs out of the Misty Mountains, who penetrated as far west as the Shire. The period between III 2745 and III 2748 is recorded as being the time of worst warfare, and it was in this time that the Battle of Greenfields was fought in the Northfarthing. Arassuil was Chieftain at the time of the Long Winter.     XII Arathorn I  (Chieftain for 64 years to III 2848) It is known that Arathorn met an untimely end, though no records remain of his fate. Perhaps he was slain by Orcs or wolves, though the worst of the fighting with the Orcs of the Mountains had been over for a century before his death.     XIII Argonui  (Chieftain for 64 years to III 2912) The last winter of Argonui's rule was the so-called Fell Winter, in which the northern lands were troubled by White Wolves out of the north, and the floods from the snow-melts of the following spring spread destruction far and wide.     XIV Arador  (Chieftain for 18 years to III 2930) Arador enjoyed only a short time as Chieftain, during which he saw his son Arathorn wed Gilraen. Soon after, journeying in the fells north of Rivendell, he was captured by hill-trolls and slain.     XV Arathorn II  (Chieftain for 3 years to III 2933) Arathorn's time as leader of the Rangers was even shorter than his father's. After just three years as Chieftain, he went hunting Orcs with Elladan and Elrohir, and was shot by an arrow. He was succeeded by his son Aragorn, then just two years old.     XVI Aragorn II  (Chieftain for 86 years to III 30191) Most famous of all the Chieftains, Aragorn had great friendship with the Wizard Gandalf. He journeyed the length and breadth of Middle-earth, doing heroic deeds in the service of both Rohan and Gondor. He played a great part in the War of the Ring, and at its end as rightful Heir of Isildur took up the Kingship of his noble ancestor, reuniting the North- and South-kingdoms after more than three thousand years.

	A family of Shire-hobbits, of whom several were present at Bilbo Baggin's Birthday Party.  Their main connection with the Baggins family was through Bilbo's grandfather, the Old Took, whose wife Adamanta Chubb was mother to no fewer than twelve children, including Bilbo's mother Belladonna.

Circles of the World
	[circlesoftheworld.txt]
	The boundaries of the Earth

	Other entries that link to this page:
	&nbsp;&#149; Lay of Leithian
	A general term that seems to refer to the boundaries between the World and the Outer Void, though its usage is vague and does not seem to be completely consistent.  In its earlier uses, it appears to be a completely inclusive term, describing the entirety of the World and its surrounding seas and airs, and explicitly including the Undying Lands of Aman.  The region beyond the Circles is the place where Il&#250;vatar dwells (presumably with those of the Ainur who did not descend into Arda), and it is the fate of Men to pass out of the Circles of the World after death.
	After the Downfall of N&#250;menor, the term becomes more narrow in meaning.  After the Bending of the World, and the taking away of Aman, the lands of the Uttermost West are said to be no longer within the Circles of the World, though they are clearly still part of the World in some sense.  After this point, it seems that the Circles of the World are simply the boundaries of the Mortal Lands of Middle-earth.

C&#237;rdan the Shipwright
	[cirdan.txt]
	The keeper of the Grey Havens
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Uncertain.  Possibly awoke at Cuivi&#233;nen, probably sailed into the West with the last ship some time in the Fourth Age
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Teleri
	Family:
	Not known.  Possibly of the kin of Olw&#235;.
	Titles:
	The Shipwright
	Pronunciation:
	keer'dan
	Meaning:
	Literally 'ship-wright'
	A lord of the Teleri in Middle-earth, C&#237;rdan was persuaded to remain in Beleriand with some of his people by Oss&#235; when the other Teleri were taken into the West by Ulmo.  Lord of the Falas during much of the First Age, he removed to the Isle of Balar after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. At the end of the First Age, with the destruction of Beleriand, he moved eastwards and founded Mithlond, the Grey Havens, on the Gulf of Lh&#251;n.He remained in Lindon throughout the Second and Third Ages.  Throughout the Second Age, that land was under the direct rule of High King Gil-galad.  At the time of the fall of Eregion, Celebrimbor sent two of the Three Rings north to the High King, and Gil-galad in turn passed one of these to C&#237;rdan; Narya, the Ring of Fire.  At the end of the Second Age, Gil-galad fell in the War of the Last Alliance, leaving Lindon without a ruler.  His natural heir would have been Elrond, who had long since removed to Imladris, and so C&#237;rdan took on the leadership of the Elves west of the Blue Mountains.C&#237;rdan continued to maintain the havens at Mithlond throughout the Third Age and into the Fourth.  When the Wizards arrived in Middle-earth, he perceived that Gandalf was the wisest of them, and gave him the Red Ring to bear in secret. He took an active part in the events of the Third Age, too; it was his mariners, for example, who sought to rescue Arvedui the last King of Arthedain. He was still the master of the Grey Havens at the end of the Age, when he saw the Ring-bearers' White Ship, that he had held in preparation over the long years, pass into the West.

	Ciryaher, the son of King Ciryandil, was to become the last of Gondor's four Ship-kings.  The haven of Umbar had been captured by his grandfather E&#228;rnil, but Gondor had been hard put to defend the haven since its capture.  Ciryaher's father was himself lost in an assault by the Haradrim, holding the defence of Umbar.  Ciryaher was a patient man, and slowly built his fleets and his armies in the north until he was sure of victory.  At last, thirty-five years after his father's loss, he launched an unstoppable assault on the southern lands, and utterly conquered the Men of Harad.  From this time, Ciryaher took the name Hyarmendacil, signifying 'South-victor'.Ciryaher ruled in Gondor for one hundred and thirty-four years, and brought that land to the height of its glory.  He was succeeded by his son Atanatar II Alcarin.

	Lesser dragons; those of dragon-kind who did not have the ability to make fire.They were used by Morgoth in the wars of the First Age, though no specific mention of them in this period remains in Tolkien's published work.  After the War of Wrath, in which most would have perished, some few seem to have escaped into the northern regions of Middle-earth, beyond the Grey Mountains.As the millennia passed, their numbers grew, until they became a serious threat in the later centuries of the Third Age to the Dwarves that mined the Grey Mountains.  In the year 2589 of the Third Age, D&#225;in I, King of Durin's Folk, and his second son Fr&#243;r were slain at the gates of their halls by a Cold-drake.  The attacks of these fearsome creatures persuaded the Dwarves to migrate eastwards from the Grey Mountains, and it was soon afterwards that their realms in the Iron Hills and at Erebor were established.Of the history of the Cold-drakes after this period we are given no hint.  Four hundred years later, at the time of Bilbo Baggins' journey to Erebor, they seem to have left the Grey Mountains (at least, Gandalf makes no mention of them when describing the dangers of that region).  It is possible that the Orcs who colonised the Mountains after the departure of the Dwarves drove them back into the cold wastes to the north, but we can do no more than speculate on their ultimate fate.

Their geography is uncertain (all that is known for sure is that they lay to the north of Rivendell) but circumstantial evidence suggests that they were probably synonymous with the region known as the Ettenmoors.  This is based on a description of the Ettenmoors in The Fellowship of the Ring I 12, where they're described as 'the troll-fells north of Rivendell' - it seems rather unlikely that there were two separate sets of troll-infested moorland in this area.

	Given that Frodo the Ring-bearer was received here, it would be tempting to imagine that the field had been named in his honour: 'Cormallen, the Field of the Golden Ring'.  In fact, this connection seems to be entirely coincidental.  In the Appendix to The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien notes that the field was known as 'the golden ring' simply because it was encircled by red-golden culumalda trees.

	Men
	The people of Umbar during the later Third Age, largely descended from Castamir the Usurper and his followers, who, though they were Gondorian in origin, continued a long enmity against the land of their ancestors.
	Notes
	1
	The date of the Gondor's loss of Umbar is not recorded.  All we know for sure, from Appendix A to The Lord of the Rings, is that '...in the evils that soon befell Gondor Umbar was again lost, and fell into the hands of the Men of Harad'. The 'evils that soon befell' were the waves of assault on Gondor, especially by the Wainriders, that started in III 1856.The fact that Umbar 'fell into the hands' of the Haradrim seems to suggest that Gondor voluntarily withdrew its occupying force to meet the Wainrider threat, rather than losing it to military action.  This is open to question, but what seems clear is that the Haradrim permitted, and indeed probably encouraged, the Corsairs to resume their raids on Gondor's coasts.
	2
	The last we hear of the Corsairs is on 13 March III 3019, the date that Aragorn captured their fleet and sailed it to the aid of Minas Tirith.  This was not their first defeat at Aragorn's hands.  Nearly forty years earlier, in his guise of Thorongil, he led a devastating Gondorian attack on Umbar that left the Corsairs' fleets all but destroyed.  After these two great defeats, and given the growth in Gondor's power after the War of the Ring, it seems unlikely the Corsairs survived long into the Fourth Age.

'Long Horn', as Holman was known, is also the first of the Cottons to be explicitly connected with the village of Bywater, which remained the seat of the family from that time on.  Indeed, the name 'Cotton' means 'cottage town', and may actually be a reference to Bywater village.Holman's son Tolman farmed the lands to the south of Bywater, and it was he who made the family one of the most important in the Shire.  He played a significant part in the decisive Battle of Bywater, the most important step in the recovery of the Shire from Sharkey's Men, and his daughter Rose married Sam Gamgee in the following spring.

Glorfindel suggested something similar: carrying the Ring west to the Great Sea and casting it in.  Both of these courses were thought too dangerous to attempt, and rejected for other reasons besides.Boromir of Gondor had a bolder proposal: to take the Ring and wield it against its maker.  The dangers of doing this were all too clear, and none of those present who might have taken up the Ring would agree to do so.The final conclusion of the Council was to follow the course devised by Elrond himself, to carry the Ring into Mordor and cast it into Mount Doom.  By no means all the Council agreed with this course. Erestor in particular saw little hope of succeeding.  'That is the path of despair,' he said, 'Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 2, The Council of Elrond).Nonetheless, Elrond's plan was accepted as the only course possible.  As Gandalf said, 'It is wisdom to recognise necessity, when all other courses have been weighed...' (ibid).  Frodo the Ring-bearer took on the task, and a Company for him was assembled from five others of those present at the council, to which were added the hobbits Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.  This was the Company or Fellowship of the Ring, that set out from Rivendell on the journey that Erestor had called the 'path of despair'.

	In his account of Arvedui's claim on Gondor's throne, Tolkien once mentions a body known as the Council of Gondor, who act as the legal authority of Gondor after the loss of Ondoher left it kingless.  Except for the fact that it acted under the control of Steward Pelendur, we are told almost nothing of this Council or its normal function.It was traditional among the Men of N&#250;menor for the King to maintain a council of advisers, and it is not unreasonable to presume that their descendants in Gondor followed a similar system.  The N&#250;men&#243;rean 'Council of the Sceptre' was composed of nobles from each of the main regions of N&#250;menor, together with the King's Heir.  It is fair to assume, then, that Gondor's Council was made up from representatives of each of the South-kingdom's separate lands, probably in addition to the King's heir, and apparently the Steward as well.

	Passes:
	Orfalch Echor
	Pronunciation:
	criss/eye/'grim (/eye/ represents the sound of the English word 'eye')
	Meaning:
	Usually interpreted 'abode of eagles'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Part of the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains
	The sheer-sided peaks to the south of the concealed city of Gondolin; in their heights were the eyries of Thorondor and his Eagles.From the peaks of the Crissaegrim, the Eagles guarded Gondolin from outsiders, and more than once they swept down from those inaccessible heights to play a part in the history of Middle-earth.  It was from these mountains that Thorondor swooped to attack Morgoth himself after the Fall of Fingolfin, and to rescue Fingolfin's body from Morgoth's Wolves.
	Notes
	1
	'Abode of Eagles' doesn't appear to be a literal translation: the Elvish roots used in Crissaegrim are difficult to render into English.  Literally, the term seems to mean something like 'host of clefts and peaks': that is, a region with many deep ravines and towering precipices.

	The Ruin of Beleriand
	For more than four centuries, the forces of the Noldor had besieged Morgoth in his northern fortress of Angband, holding the northern mountain fences of Beleriand and their passes against his forces.  In I 455 Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the battle that came to be known as the Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame.The Battle began one night in winter, when Morgoth sent out rivers of flame from Angband that consumed the wide plains of Ard-galen.  Then came his armies of Balrogs and Orcs, led by Glaurung the dragon.  They forced the highlands of Dorthonion, and took the fortresses of Angrod and Aegnor who dwelt there.  Maglor's Gap was also taken, giving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand itself.Maedhros' fortress on Himring held against the tide of foes, and so did the tower of Minas Tirith in the west, and the mountain forts of Ered Wethrin.  Nonetheless, the Siege was broken, the Sons of F&#235;anor scattered, and the forces of Morgoth roamed at will throughout the northern lands.As the battle raged against the Mountains of Shadow, Fingolfin the High King rode in anger across the dust of Anfauglith (the plain that had been Ard-galen) and challenged Morgoth to single combat.  At the doors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, but though Morgoth was wounded, Fingolfin was destroyed by the Hammer of the Underworld.

	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Battle-under-Stars, The Second Battle
	The Second Battle of the Wars of Beleriand, fought between the followers of F&#235;anor and Morgoth's armies in the Noldor's first days in Middle-earth.  The battle was fought so soon after F&#235;anor's return that the Moon had not yet risen for the first time, hence the name Dagor-nuin-Giliath, meaning 'Battle-under-Stars'.
	After their return, F&#235;anor had led his people up the Firth of Drengist, and then eastward to Lake Mithrim, on whose shore they camped.  Morgoth saw an opportunity to wipe out his enemies, and sent a vast army of Orcs to launch a surprise attack on the Noldor.  Though the Orcs greatly outnumbered the Elves, and had the advantage of surprise, the Noldor quickly turned the tide and routed their enemy.  Many Orcs fled back over the Mountains, where they joined with reinforcing armies, but still they were no match for the Elves.  Celegorm and his hunters chased them across Ard-galen and into the Fen of Serech, where they were destroyed.
	Though it was a mighty victory for the people of F&#235;anor, the battle saw the end of F&#235;anor himself.  Filled with wrath, he charged on towards Angband, thinking to utterly defeat Morgoth and retrieve the Silmarils.  So he left his armies behind, and with just a few soldiers left to him, he was set upon by Balrogs, and fatally wounded.  He died soon after, leaving his seven sons to fulfil the great Oath they had taken with their father.
	The Dagor-nuin-Giliath changed the face of Beleriand.  Before the battle, Orcs had wandered widely outside the protected realm of Doriath, and besieged the shoreland Havens of the Falas.  After the battle, the few that remained of Morgoth's hosts had fled back to their master in the North.  Though the ultimate cause of the battle was Morgoth's miscalculation of the power of the Noldor, this was not widely understood.  Many of the native Sindar of Beleriand mistakenly thought the returning Noldor had been sent by the Valar to free them from the Orcs.  In a dark irony, centuries later the Sindarin kingdom of Doriath would be sacked and destroyed by the very Noldorin princes that they believed to be their saviours.

Darkening of Valinor
	[darkeningofvalinor.txt]
	The destruction of the Two Trees
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Approximately fifty years before the beginning of the First Age1
	Location:
	The mound of Ezellohar, west of Valmar
	The destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by Morgoth and Ungoliant shortly before the beginning of the First Age.
	Notes
	1
	The Annals of Aman date the Darkening as happening in YT 1495 (that is, the 1,495 Valian Year since the Trees first bloomed - 'YT' stands for 'Year of the Trees').  The first rising of the Moon, marking the beginning of the First Age, is dated on the same system as YT 1500.  One Valian Year is equal to about 9.6 solar years, so the period in question was forty-eight years in our terms, though this must be something of an approximation.  (The Annals of Aman are to be found in volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth, Morgoth's Ring).

Dark Lord

	A title of Morgoth, and of his servant Sauron
	Timeline:
	Race:
	Ainur
	The title given to the two great Ainur who ruled the forces of darkness in Middle-earth, Morgoth and Sauron.The First Dark Lord: MorgothMorgoth descended into Arda at its beginning, and battled with the Valar for ages uncounted before the awakening of Elves and Men from his fortress at Utumno in the north of the world.  The Valar defeated him and imprisoned him for three ages, but on his release he returned to Angband, north of Beleriand.  During the First Age, the Noldor made hopeless war upon him for the return of the Silmarils, but at last the Valar came to their aid and overthrew Morgoth, banishing him forever from the World.The Second Dark Lord: SauronSauron was the ancient lieutenant of Morgoth, and after the first Dark Lord's defeat, he took on his mantle and became a Dark Lord himself during the early Second Age.  Taking the land of Mordor to dwell in, he corrupted the N&#250;men&#243;reans.  Though he was defeated at the end of the Second Age, and his Dark Tower of Barad-d&#251;r was thrown down, he rose again during the Third Age, and was finally defeated with the destruction of the One Ring in 3019 (Third Age).

	DENETHOR II
	Finduilas
	Boromir
	Faramir
	Born during the Stewardship of his grandfather Turgon, Denethor was a  Gondorian noble who would see some of the most turbulent times in his country's long history, culminating in the War of the Ring itself.  While still a youth of twenty-one, he saw Sauron re-emerge as the Dark Lord of Mordor, and start building his power on Gondor's eastern borders.  Just a few short years later, Mount Doom burst into fire once again.  In Gondor's time of need, a new hero arose, and for a time Steward Ecthelion II (who had recently succeeded his father Turgon) was served by the mysterious captain Thorongil (who was long afterwards discovered to be none other than Aragorn of the Northern D&#250;nedain).Nearly twenty years passed, and beneath the looming threat of Mordor, Denethor wedded Finduilas, the daughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth.  Together they had two sons, Boromir and Faramir.  Soon after, Denethor's father Ecthelion died, and Denethor succeeded to become Steward Denethor II.Just four years after Denethor succeeded to the Stewardship, Finduilas died at a young age for one of her line. For the next thirty years, Denethor ruled as a grim and serious Steward, and it later became known that for at least some of this time, he had made use of a palant&#237;r to gain knowledge, through which the malice of Sauron had begun to sap his will.  In the end, the death of his elder son Boromir, and the imagined loss of his younger son Faramir, sent him mad. He burned himself to death with his palant&#237;r in his hands.Denethor II ruled as Steward for thirty-five years, and was succeeded by his younger son Faramir.
	Notes
	1
	'Denethor' was the name of a hero of the Nandor in the Elder Days, slain in the First Battle before the beginning of the First Age.  It was common practice for members of the House of H&#250;rin to take the names of ancient heroes, so it seems more likely that Denethor II, and his ancestor Denethor I, were named after this ancient Denethor, rather than being lithe and lank themselves.

	Denethor I was the tenth Steward to rule Gondor, in whose time the realm suffered perhaps the most calamitous upheaval in its history.  When Denethor succeeded his childless uncle Dior in III 2435, Gondor had known peace for many generations.  Nearly four hundred years earlier, during the Stewardship of Denethor's noble ancestor Mardil, Gandalf had gone to Dol Guldur and forced Sauron to withdraw into the east of Middle-earth. Though it was known that the Nazg&#251;l still infested Minas Morgul, they offered no threat to the South-kingdom, and Denethor had every reason to hope that this time of Watchful Peace would continue in his time.He was wrong.  III 2460, the twenty-fifth of Denethor's rule, would be last year to see Gondor fully at peace for nearly six centuries.  In that year, Sauron gave up his exile and returned to his fortress of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.  Just a few years later, it was seen that the Nazg&#251;l had not been idle in the years of the Peace - they unleashed a force of hideous soldier-orcs on Gondor, of the kind that was then unknown, but would become known as the Uruk-hai. They ravaged Ithilien and took Osgiliath, but Denethor's heir Boromir fought them back and recovered Gondor's holdings east of the River, though he was dreadfully wounded.  These were the first skirmishes in a conflict that would not truly end until the time of the War of the Ring.Denethor I ruled as Steward for forty-two years, and was succeeded by his son Boromir.

	A direct descendant of Eorl the Young, who inherited the Kingship of Rohan from his father Goldwine.  D&#233;or's great-great-grandfather, Aldor the Old, had hunted out the Dunlendings that had harried the eastern borders of Rohan, and his successors Fr&#233;a, Fr&#233;awine and Goldwine had enjoyed peaceful reigns because of their ancestor's enterprises. In D&#233;or's time, this peace came to an end.It was later discovered that the Dunlendings had secretly been moving back into the northwestern uplands of Rohan throughout the reigns of D&#233;or's predecessors.  By D&#233;or's own time, a powerful Dunlendish force had been established, and the King was forced to ride northward from Edoras, ultimately to defeat his enemies.  The victory was a bitter one, though, for he discovered that the Dunlendings had also captured the Ring of Isengard, which D&#233;or had no possible means of recapturing. So D&#233;or's reign saw the beginning of a danger from the north that would reach a crisis nearly fifty years later, when the Dunlendings were to come close to destroying Rohan alogether.D&#233;or's turbulent reign lasted nineteen years.  He was succeeded as King by his son, Gram.

The desolate lands extended southwards some miles along the banks of the River Running from Smaug's lair beneath the Lonely Mountain, but the lands to the north of the mountain seem to have suffered even more fiercely, if the map accompanying The Hobbit is a reliable record.  After Smaug's death, it seems that the Desolation was slowly reclaimed, so that both Erebor and Dale were eventually to recover from their destruction and prosper once again.

	Dior's grandfather Hador was the last truly long-lived of the Stewards, and ruled Gondor for one hundred and seventeen years.  This meant that his son Barahir, and his grandson Dior both came late to the Stewardship and ruled for only a brief time.  Dior was the last Steward to enjoy an untroubled rule, as his heir Denethor would see the breaking of the Watchful Peace, and the beginning of centuries of warfare.Dior is remarkable as the only recorded Ruling Steward to leave no direct heir.  In volume XII of The History of Middle-earth we're told that he had no children of his own, and was succeeded therefore by the son of his sister R&#237;an.  This seems to be borne out by the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, which state that Gondor's Stewardship became '...hereditary as a kingship, from father to son or nearest kin.' (Appendix A iv The Stewards, our italics).  This reference to 'nearest kin' seems intended to refer specifically to Dior.Dior ruled as Steward for twenty-three years, and seems to have been succeeded by his nephew Denethor I.

	Tolkien doesn't give the exact date of the Orcs' attack, but we can calculate it from associated information. We know that Isildur set out on Yavanni&#235; 5 (by the calendar of N&#250;menor), and that he was attacked on the thirtieth day of his journey.  According to the King's Reckoning, that would be Narqueli&#235; 4.  That translates onto the Shire Calendar as the fourth day of Winterfilth (October), or onto a modern calendar as 25 September.

	Meaning:
	'Headland of Amroth'2
	A headland of western Gondor, ruled as a hereditary princedom by the descendants of Galador during the last millennium of the Third Age.
	Notes
	1
	The first Lord of Dol Amroth was Galador, who lived between III 2004 and III 2129.  His father Imraz&#246;r is stated to have lived in Belfalas, so Galador seems to have been the founder of Dol Amroth, as well as its first Lord, which must place its beginnings during his lifetime.  Tolkien nowhere gives us the specific date of its foundation.
	2
	Dol Amroth takes its name from Amroth the former King of L&#243;rien, who was lost at sea near the headland in III 1981, only about a century before Dol Amroth was founded.  Indeed, according to the tradition of his house, Galador's mother was Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf who had accompanied Amroth's beloved Nimrodel on her southward journey from L&#243;rien.

	1
	The word dol literally means 'head', not 'hill', but it is often used figuratively in the names of high or prominent places (Dol Amroth and Dol Baran are further examples).  'Hill', then, is not an exact interpretation - there is no precise English equivalent of dol used in this way.

Doom of Men
	[doomofmen.txt]
	The later name for the Gift of Men
	&quot;...I must indeed abide the Doom of Men, whether I will or I nill: the loss and the silence.&quot;
	Words of Arwenfrom The Tale of Aragorn and Arwenin The Lord of the Rings Appendix A I (v)
	In their origins, Elves and Men were given two separate and different fates: the Elves were 'immortal', or at least they remained in the World for the long millennia until its end.  Men, though, were made mortal, and after a few short decades they would leave the World and pass out of the knowledge of Valar and Elves alike.  This was not at first seen as a fearful thing, and the idea of death was referred to as the Gift of Men, to be accepted freely by each at the proper time.
	As the shadow of Morgoth spread darkness throughout Middle-earth, so Men came to see death not as a Gift, but as a thing to be feared or even  - if it were possible - escaped.  After this time, it became known as the Doom of Men.  The N&#250;men&#243;reans, despite their long lives, showed a particular fear of their fate, clinging to life until its last moments, and housing their preserved dead in great tombs.  At last, driven on by Sauron, King Ar-Pharaz&#244;n led an immense army in an attempt to wrest the Undying Lands from the Valar, and achieve their unending life for himself.  His hopeless quest for immortality brought its opposite to his people: N&#250;menor was utterly destroyed, and the Doom of Men was visited upon all its inhabitants.

According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway through which to expel Morgoth.  The Door of Night was guarded by E&#228;rendil, bearing his Silmaril aloft in his shining ship Vingilot.

	After Felagund's death, T&#250;rin came to dwell in Nargothrond, and he persuaded King Orodreth to change this secretive policy, and to build a great bridge before the Doors of Felagund, so that his armies could more easily pass across the Narog.  This was a dire error, because it gave Morgoth's forces a means to approach the Doors.  After the Battle of Tumhalad, Glaurung the Dragon came against the Doors of Felagund and destroyed them, allowing the Orcs to sack the once-mighty citadel.

	&nbsp;&#149; Two Captains
	In Doriath, T&#250;rin Turambar and Beleg Strongbow were great friends and comrades in arms. Through a tragic mistake, T&#250;rin caused the death of one of King Thingol's courtiers, and fled the land where he had grown up.  After many adventures in the wild, he joined himself to an outlaw band who eventually came to the occupy the hill known as Amon Rudh.  This was the old home of a family of Petty-dwarves, M&#238;m and his sons, who gave his home over to the outlaws in ransom for his life.One day in the midst of winter, Beleg sought out his old friend T&#250;rin, and they formed an alliance to defend that region against the Orcs of Morgoth.  T&#250;rin took a new name, Gorthol, from the dreadful helm of his ancestors that Beleg had brought to him.  Together with T&#250;rin's outlaws, they commanded a land that stretched from the River Teiglin in the north to the edges of Doriath in the south and east.  This land was given the name Dor-C&#250;arthol, the Land of Bow and Helm; the name comes from Beleg's great bow and the Dragon-helm of Dor-l&#243;min borne by T&#250;rin.The land of Dor-C&#250;arthol was to survive for less than a year.  Perceiving that 'Gorthol' was truly T&#250;rin the son of H&#250;rin, Morgoth sent his spies to watch the lands around Amon Rudh.  M&#238;m the Petty-dwarf, whose mansions the Two Captains had occupied, struck a bargain with the captain of Morgoth's Orcs, and betrayed Beleg and T&#250;rin.  The outlaws were routed, Beleg was left for dead, and T&#250;rin was captured and led away to the north.  Though Beleg in fact survived, and later rescued T&#250;rin, this was the end of the short-lived land of Dor-C&#250;arthol.

Dor-en-Ernil

	Land of the Prince
	A coastland region of southern Gondor.  Its name is Elvish for 'Land of the Prince', a reference to the Princes of Dol Amroth.  Its boundaries are not entirely clear: the maps in The Lord of the Rings seem to show it some miles to the east of Dol Amroth, separated from that headland by an unnamed range of hills.  Given its connection to the Princes, though, it seems implausible that it would be disconnected from their citadel, so the placing of its label on the maps is probably no more than a convenience.  The most likely interpretation seems to be that the land of Dor-en-Ernil ran from coast to coast between the mouths of the Ringl&#243; and the Gilrain, to the north of the wide cape of Belfalas.

	At the ending of the Quest of the Silmaril, Beren met his death at the jaws of the great wolf Carcharoth.  So great was L&#250;thien's love of him, though, that she surrendered her own immortality so that he might return to Middle-earth for a time.They returned out of the Halls of Waiting, and on the green island of Tol Galen in the southern lands of Ossiriand, they lived in a Land of the Dead that Live, or Dor Firn-i-Guinar in the Elventongue.No mortal Man saw Beren or L&#250;thien ever again, but they had happy relations with the Green-elves of Ossiriand who lived around them.  After the slaying of L&#250;thien's father Thingol, Beren took a force of Green-elves north to avenge his death, and recover the stolen Silmaril.From that time, the Silmaril was kept in Dor Firn-i-Guinar and borne by L&#250;thien, and that land was said to become 'like a vision of the land of the Valar'1. Dior, the son of Beren and L&#250;thien, then left Dor Firn-i-Guinar with his family, and went to take up the rule his lost grandfather's kingdom of Doriath.Both Beren and L&#250;thien were mortal, and at last their lives came to an end, and with them their Land of the Dead that Live.  A lord of the Green-elves took the Silmaril, and brought it to their heir, Dior, in Doriath, and Dor Firn-i-Guinar was no more.

	&nbsp;&#149; Gorthol
	A visored steel helm, embossed and embellished with gold, that bore as its crest the head of Glaurung the Dragon.  It was made originally for Azagh&#226;l of Belegost, who gave it as a gift to Maedhros, who in turn passed it on to his cousin Fingon.  When Fingon made Hador the Lord of Dor-l&#243;min, he granted the Dragon-helm to the new lord, and indeed legend tells that only Hador and his son Galdor had the strength to bear the mighty helm.There was at least one other Man strong enough the bear the helm: Galdor's grandson T&#250;rin.  He often wore the Dragon-helm to war, and took one of his many names from it: Gorthol, the Dread Helm.  The last clear record of the Dragon-helm is at the Battle of Tumhalad, where T&#250;rin is known to have worn it.  Beyond this, there is a suggestion that he may have taken it with him to Brethil, and perhaps even worn it at the slaying of Glaurung himself.  After that point, the great heirloom of the House of Hador is lost to history.

Dragons

	The Worms of Morgoth
	Timeline:

	First recorded in c. I 265; still extant
	Types:
	Cold-drakes, Fire-drakes, Long-worms, Were-worms
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Worms
	Meaning:
	Ultimately from the Greek drakon, meaning 'serpent'
	Mighty reptilian creatures who ranked among the most feared of the servants of the Dark Lord. Of the origins of dragons, no tale tells; the first of them to be seen was Glaurung, Father of Dragons, who first issued from Angband in the middle of the First Age.  After Glaurung came many others to strike fear into Elves and Men for the next three ages; among them were Ancalagon the first winged dragon, Scatha who dwelt in the cold northern wastes, and Smaug, last of the great dragons.Dragons have powers of intelligence and speech, and many are also able to cast the dragon-spell, a bewildering confusion that affects any who gaze into the eye of the creature.The dragons were not destroyed at the end of the Third Age; some are said to have survived to our own time, but the great worms and drakes of the Elder Days are no more.

We also know that it did not exist at the time when the N&#250;men&#243;reans began their exploitation of Middle-earth in about II 1800, so it must have come into existence within a few centuries of this date.

	&quot;Moria! Moria!  Wonder of the Northern world!  Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear.&quot;
	Words of Gl&#243;in fromThe Lord of the Rings 2 II The Council of Elrond
	When the Valar came against Morgoth at the end of the First Age, most of his servants were destroyed, but some few fled into the World and hid themselves in dark places.  One such was a Balrog, probably the last of its kind in Middle-earth, that escaped into the east from the ruin of Angband and buried itself in the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath Khazad-d&#251;m2.For more than five millennia, the Balrog 'slept' in its deep hiding place (perhaps it was using this time to grow in power, or rebuild its physical form).  It remained undisturbed as the Second Age passed, and long into the Third.  At last, the mithril-miners of King Durin VI stumbled upon it and it awoke from its long sleep3.  Durin was slain by the creature and his son N&#225;in I became King.It seems that, under N&#225;in, the Dwarves attempted to make a stand against the Balrog, but it was a power too great for them to control.  For a year, they attempted to hold their mansions against it, but at last N&#225;in and many of his subjects were slain, and the survivors fled from their ancient halls.  At this time too, many of the Silvan Elves of L&#243;rien left their land and escaped into the south.For some five hundred years, Moria (as Khazad-d&#251;m became known) was deserted but for the Balrog.  In around the year 2480, though, Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect, and as part of these, he sent orcs and trolls to infest the Misty Mountains and bar the passes from Eriador into Rhovanion.  Some of these creatures came to Moria.We are not told whether Sauron was aware of the Balrog's existence until then - certainly the exiled Dwarves had not recognised what kind of creature Durin's Bane was.  It is clear, though, that the Balrog acknowledged Sauron's authority - if only because  it allowed his creatures to remain in Moria.  In addition, the messenger of Sauron who came to D&#225;in II Ironfoot offered to return Moria to the Dwarves, which would have been impossible if the Balrog was not under Sauron's power.Despite an ill-fated attempt to recolonise Moria by Balin in III 2989, Durin's Bane remained a dark and brooding menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, whose nature was hidden to the outside world.In January III 3019, the Company of the Ring travelled through Moria on the Quest of Mount Doom.  In Gandalf, the Balrog finally encountered a being of the same order and power as itself.  As the two Maiar faced each other on the Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m, Gandalf broke the Bridge and the Balrog fell into the depths, but Gandalf too was drawn into the abyss.Both survived the fall, and Gandalf pursued the Balrog for eight days through the deepest caverns beneath Moria.  At last they came to the Endless Stair, and climbed the steps that led to the peak of Zirakzigil.  There Durin's Bane fought its last battle - for two days and nights, the Balrog battled with Gandalf, but at last it was cast from the peak, and broke the mountain-side as it plunged to its doom.
	Notes
	1
	The Balrog itself was much older than this - it had entered Arda soon after its foundation as one of the servants of Melkor - but it was not known as Durin's Bane until after its awakening by the Dwarves.
	2
	Khazad-d&#251;m was already thriving at this time, and it seems strange that the creature should choose to hide so close to a busy Dwarf-city, and that it should be able to do so without the Dwarves' knowledge.  As a Maia, it would have the power to cast off its physical form, and this perhaps accounts for its ability to remain undetected for so long.
	3
	In Appendix A III (Durin's Folk) of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien hints that the Dwarves may in fact not have awoken the Balrog, but that instead it was the growing power of Sauron in nearby Dol Guldur that returned it to life.  If this is true, then the Dwarves did no more than release the creature from its subterranean tomb.  It is certainly notable that Durin's Bane appeared in the same year that the Nazg&#251;l returned to Mordor.

	&quot;The first day of the dwarves' New Year ... is as all should know the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter.&quot;
	Words of Thorin Oakenshield, from The Hobbit 3 A Short Rest
	The first day of the Dwarves' year was calculated according to the last new moon of autumn (that is, the new moon that occurs within two weeks of 6 October, on a modern calendar).  Not every Dwarves' new year was a Durin's Day, though: Thorin says 'We still call it Durin's Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky together.' (ibid).  Only a Dwarvish new year where this occurs is technically a Durin's Day.
	The Mysterious Calendar of the DwarvesDwarvish New YearsA selection of modern Dwarvish new years: all dates are shown in the modern (Gregorian) calendar200116 October20026 October200326 September200414 October20053 October200622 September200711 October200829 September200918 October20107 October201127 SeptemberThursday 14 October 2004 is a definite Durin's Day: not only do the Sun and Moon appear in the sky together, but a partial solar eclipse occurs.  The occurrence of other Durin's Days will depend on longitude (see below).Browse through Appendix D of The Lord of the Rings, and you'll discover in great detail how the calendars of Hobbits, Men and Elves worked.  Strangely, though, Tolkien has nothing to say there about Dwarves: the only clues we have to their calendar are from Thorin's words quoted in The Hobbit.As so often with Tolkien, though, we can deduce an awful lot from one sentence. It's clear that the Dwarves had a lunar calendar.  Our modern calendar, and all those described in Appendix D, are solar calendars: they're based on the Sun's annual motion through the sky.  There is an alternative, though: it's possible to design a calendar based on the phases of the moon, and the Dwarves must have used a calendar of this kind.A lunar calendar works by breaking down time into periods of roughly four weeks, during which the moon changes from new to full to new again.  This approach has one big advantage that solar calendars lack - the face of the moon acts like a gigantic 'sundial' marking out the passage of each 'lunar month'.  You can see this in action in Sam's reaction after the Fellowship leave L&#243;rien, and the Moon has an unexpected phase: 'either it's out of its running, or I'm all wrong in my reckoning' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 9 The Great River).  Sam thinks of the moon in much the same way as a watch or clock, as have many peoples throughout history.Regulating a calendar by the moon instead of the sun might be useful from one perspective, but it also has a big disadvantage.  A lunar year (twelve lunar months) is only 354 days long: eleven days short of a solar year.  For every solar year that passes, the calendar will 'slip' back by more than a week.  This is much more than a technical inconvenience, because the passage of seasons follows the solar year, not the lunar.  Any given date will 'shift' by six months every seventeen years or so - midsummer becomes midwinter in less than a generation.The Dwarves seem to have taken a direct approach to this problem - they reset their calendar every single year.  When Thorin says that their year starts on 'the first day of the last moon of Autumn', what he means is that the Dwarves find a point where the lunar and solar (seasonal) calendars coincide, and restart their calendar from that point.Perhaps the most curious outcome of this is that Dwarvish years have a variable number of months, sometimes twelve, and sometimes thirteen.  Tolkien doesn't mention this 'leap month' (which would occur quite often) directly, but it must have occurred2.Another peculiarity of the Dwarves' calendar relates to Durin's Day itself.  In most cases, only Dwarves at the right longitude will experience Durin's Day.  A perfect example is the Durin's Day we know occurred in 2941 of the Third Age (the one described in The Hobbit).  As with most Durin's Days (eclipses are an exception), the moon and sun can only be seen together in the early morning or late evening.  Bilbo saw the crescent moon as the sun was setting over Erebor.Erebor, though, is in the distant east of Middle-earth.  At the time Bilbo was seeing 'a thin new moon above the rim of the Earth.' (The Hobbit 11, On the Doorstep), the Sun was still fairly high in the sky over the Blue Mountains, a thousand miles or more to the west. By the time the sun was low enough for the Dwarves in the Blue Mountains to see the moon, it would already have set!  It was Durin's Day for the Dwarves at Erebor, then, but not for their cousins in the west.We can hardly blame Thorin for saying 'it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come again'! (The Hobbit 3, A Short Rest)Everything we've said here follows unavoidably from Thorin's few comments in The Hobbit. What we can't say, of course, is whether Tolkien realized these astronomical consequences. He obviously had a very good understanding of how calendars work: the fictional calendars in Appendix D are beautifully constructed, and in some ways an improvement on our own. The ancient idea of exactly aligning a calendar with the solstices and equinoxes, for example, is the basis for many of Tolkien's calendars - the modern Gregorian system is 'out' by ten days or so.It seems hard to believe that Tolkien would expend such effort on the development of calendars for Hobbits, Men and Elves, and yet forget the Dwarves completely. Perhaps he took a look at their calendar and decided it was too awkward to describe in detail, but if he did, he has left us no evidence.
	Notes
	1
	It isn't clear whether Durin's Day was observed by all Dwarves, or just by the Longbeards, the clan founded by Durin.
	2
	Tolkien may not detail the Dwarvish calendar directly, but there is some circumstantial evidence that he considered its operation.  This comes from the Jewish calendar, which is also lunar in form, and is also regulated against the solar calendar by the frequent insertion of an extra month.This is a more important point than it may at first appear, because Tolkien drew certain cultural and historical parallels between his fictional Khaz&#226;d and the Jewish peoples. It is known, for example, that the sounds of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves, were in part derived from Hebrew.  Bearing this in mind, it's tempting to imagine that the Dwarves' lunar calendar might represent another of these parallels.

	The eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, the first of that race to be created by the Vala Aul&#235;.  He was set to sleep under the mountains of Middle-earth until after the awakening of the Elves.When he woke, he journeyed in the wilds until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call Kheled-z&#226;ram.  Looking upon mysterious stars reflected in its surface, he took this as a sign, and there founded a great city tunnelled in the heart of the Misty Mountains.  This was Khazad-d&#251;m, later called Moria.Durin lived to a great age even by the measure of the Dwarves, but though he was called the Deathless, he was not immortal.  He died some time before the end of the First Age, but he founded the line of the Kings of Durin's Folk that extended down through the history of Middle-earth.

	The last of the seven Durins appears once in Appendix A to The Lord of the Rings, as an undated descendant of Thorin III.  As such, we know almost nothing of him apart from the bare fact of his existence.In volume 12 of The History of Middle-earth (The Peoples of Middle-earth), though, we have access to the proofs of Appendix A, and a little more of Durin's life is revealed. His birth, it seems, was prophesied at the Battle of Five Armies, and he was born several centuries later.  He led Durin's Folk back to recolonise Khazad-d&#251;m during the Fourth Age, where they remained 'until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended.'1  The status of this story is unclear, though: it never appeared in The Lord of the Rings, and may have been rejected by Tolkien after its composition.

	Notes
	1
	It is unusual for a Dwarf to live longer than about 250 years, so at 340, Dwalin seems to have lived almost a century longer than almost any other his kind.  This hints at an error, but Christopher Tolkien notes (in The History of Middle-earth volume 12) that Dwalin's date of death, given as as '3112' in years of the Third Age, remained consistent over several drafts.  However, there is a very indefinite suggestion in an early document that his age at death should have been 251, in which case he would have died in the second year of the Fourth Age.
	2
	To be precise, Dwalin was the great-grandson of Borin, one of the refounders of the Dwarf-kingdom of Erebor, and Borin was the younger son of King N&#225;in II.
	3
	At least, in the Norse poem V&#246;lusp&#225;, the source of many of Tolkien's Dwarf-names, this seems to be the meaning.

	The battle-cry of the DwarvesThe Lord of the Rings Appendix F I: Of Other Races: Dwarves
	Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves are not Children of Il&#250;vatar; they were created by Aul&#235; the Smith, though Il&#250;vatar granted them life.  Aul&#235; made seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and these slept through many ages until after the Awakening of the Elves.  Almost all the Dwarves that appear in Tolkien's works were descended from the eldest of the Seven Fathers, Durin the Deathless.Like Aul&#235; their maker, the Dwarves delighted in smithcraft and stoneworking; they mined and worked metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth.  The Dwarves kept themselves apart from the other races; their language, Khuzdul, was a closely guarded secret, and they told their true names to none but themselves (all the Dwarf-names in Tolkien are in the tongues of Elves or Men, not true Dwarf names).Origins of the DwarvesThe first Dwarves were made long ages ago by Aul&#235; the Smith.  He had dimly perceived the coming Children of Il&#250;vatar, and desired to make Children of his own to teach his many skills and arts.Aul&#235;'s work was doomed, though, because he did not have the power to grant independent life to his creations - that power belonged to Il&#250;vatar alone.  When the Dwarves were completed, though, the voice of Il&#250;vatar spoke to Aul&#235; and agreed to grant them true life, and include them in His plan for Arda.  Il&#250;vatar would not allow the Dwarves to awaken, though, until after the Firstborn (the Elves), and so Aul&#235; set them to sleep far apart from one another, deep underground, until the time came for their awakening.The History of the Dwarves Before the First AgeIl&#250;vatar promised Aul&#235; that he would awaken the Fathers of the Dwarves 'when the time comes'.  We must assume that he did so shortly after the Awakening of the Elves at Cuivi&#233;nen (very approximately between 9,000 and 10,000 years before the beginning of the First Age).It seems that not long passed after their awakening before Durin the Deathless, eldest of the Fathers, founded Khazad-d&#251;m (later called Moria) in the Misty Mountains.  Certainly it was well established as their chief citadel by the time the first Dwarves crossed the Blue Mountains into Beleriand.  This event is dated only as 'during the second age of the Captivity of Melkor', which would place it (approximately) between 3,000 and 6,000 years before the beginning of the First Age.The Dwarves had no settlement in Beleriand itself, but they built two mighty citadels in the Blue Mountains; Gabilgathol to the north and Tumunzahar to the south.  These fortress-cities are better known by the Elvish versions of their names: Belegost and Nogrod.  The Dwarves also laid the long road that ran westwards out of the Blue Mountains and along the course of the River Ascar, crossing into East Beleriand at Sarn Athrad.The Dwarves in BeleriandFor the Elves dwelling Beleriand, the first appearance of the Dwarves in the Blue Mountains was a startling revelation - until that time, the Elves had thought themselves the only speaking peoples in the World.Throughout the long ages, the Elves and Dwarves developed a mutual respect which, if not quite friendship, was far from enmity.  After their return to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, the Noldor became closest in friendship with the Dwarves - both peoples revered Aul&#235;, and both had a love of craft and making that made them natural allies.Of all the Elves of Beleriand, though, it was not a Noldo but a Sindarin Elf who became most trusted and respected by the Dwarves.  This was E&#246;l, the Dark Elf of Nan Elmoth, who travelled often to the dwarf-cities in the Blue Mountains, and who took also his son Maeglin during his youth.The Nature of the DwarvesAul&#235; made the Dwarves at a time when the World outside Aman still lay under the dominion of Melkor, and so he made them sturdy and hard to survive the dangers and hardships of that time.In nature, the typical Dwarf is stubborn and secretive.  Though they make loyal and good friends, they are also a proud and stern race.  They do not suffer grievance or insult, and their enmity is long-lasting.  They are said, though, to be quick to learn new skills.Probably the best known aspect of the Dwarvish character, though, is their strong instinctive skills in the working of metal and stone, no doubt derived from Aul&#235; their maker, the Vala whose province these things were.  In ancient times, they were said to have preferred working with copper and iron, though in later days they wrought gold and silver, and the mithril they found in the Mines of Khazad-d&#251;m.Dwarvish MortalityThough they live much longer than Men (usually around 250 years), Dwarves are mortal creatures. What happens after their death, though, is a mystery.  The Elves have said that the Dwarves return to the stone from which they were made, but the Dwarves have a different belief.According to Dwarvish tradition, they are gathered by Mahal (their name for Aul&#235;) in a part of the Halls of Mandos set aside for them. After the end of the World and the Last Battle, they say, they will aid Aul&#235; in the rebuilding of Arda.

	Notes
	1
	The mighty Eagles of the Elder Days were more than mere birds, they were gigantic, intelligent creatures.  Thorondor, the greatest of them, had a wingspan of thirty fathoms (55 metres, or 180 feet), and spoke with Elf-lords as an equal.  Beings like this first appeared after the awakening of the Elves, when spirits sent by Eru entered the World and inhabited certain of its living things (the Ents first appeared at about this time, for the same reason). 'Ordinary' eagles, of the kind we still know today, must presumably have predated the arrival of these spirits.
	2
	The Latin word for eagle, aquila, seems to be related to Aquilo, a name for the north wind.  This connection occurs in Tolkien, too.  The Eagles are the special emissaries of Manw&#235;, who rules the airs and winds of the World, and the great Eagle of the Third Age, Gwaihir, has a name that means 'Windlord'.

No-one in Gondor at that time, of course, could have known how significant that event would be: nearly three thousand years later, Arwen was to wed Aragorn, a distant descendant of E&#228;rendil's ancestor Elendil, and become Queen of his realm.
	E&#228;rendil ruled Gondor for eighty-six years, and was succeeded by his son, Anardil.

He is mentioned in the histories of the Second Age as the brother of Lind&#243;ri&#235;, who was the grandmother of the wise King Tar-Palantir.  As Lord of And&#250;ni&#235;, E&#228;rendur was also the ancestor of the Kings of the D&#250;nedain in Middle-earth: Aragorn was his direct descendant through no less than forty-four generations.

E&#228;rendur
	[earendursonoftaramandil.txt]
	The second son of Tar-Amandil
	One of the three children of Tar-Amandil, the third King of N&#250;menor.  Thus, E&#228;rendur was a great-grandson of Elros Tar-Minyatur himself, but he was not heir to the throne: his elder brother inherited the Kingship, and ruled as Tar-Elendil (these two brothers also had a younger sister, named Mairen).
	E&#228;rendur is perhaps most relevant to history for something that might have happened, but ultimately did not.  Long after his death, Tar-Elendil's grandson Tar-Aldarion failed to produce a male heir, and all the other lines of descent from Tar-Elendil were through daughters.  Thus, according to the laws of inheritance of that time, the male descendants of E&#228;rendur's line should have taken over the Kingship, with the honour probably falling on his grandson Malantur.  Tar-Aldarion prevented this by changing the law, allowing his daughter to take the Sceptre as N&#250;menor's first Ruling Queen, Tar-Ancalim&#235;.

	'The courts'
	The chief city of Rohan and the seat of its Kings, under the northern feet of the White Mountains.
	Notes
	1
	At first sight, the origins of Edoras seem straightforward to understand.  Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings tells us that Eorl '...chose for his dwelling a green hill before the feet of the White Mountains that were the south-wall of his land.'  It seems logical to assume that this describes the foundation of Edoras.This is apparently contradicted, however, by a note in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth, which tells us that Eorl lived, not at Edoras, but at nearby Aldburg in the Folde.  According to this version, it was Eorl's son Brego, not Eorl himself, who established the courts at Edoras.  This version also gains support from the text of The Lord of the Rings, which contains an account of Brego's building of Meduseld, Edoras' great hall.Resolving this conflict is awkward.  One solution, though not an entirely happy one, is to assume that Eorl's 'green hill' was not in fact the site of Edoras, but the location where his house at Aldburg would be built, and that Edoras was founded by his son some decades later.

	The son of King Valacar of Gondor and Vidumavi.  Vidumavi was the daughter of Vidugavia of the Northmen, the self-styled King of Rhovanion, and so Eldacar was of only half-Gondorian descent, a fact that led many to doubt Eldacar's right to rule.  After his father's death, he sat on the throne for just five years when civil war broke out in Gondor.  Ultimately, he was deposed by his Captain of Ships, Castamir, who took the throne himself.Eldacar escaped into the north, where he spent ten years raising an army before he returned to reclaim his throne.  In a great and bloody battle at the Crossings of Erui, Castamir was defeated and the remnant of his forces fled into the south, to Umbar.  Eldacar ruled for another forty-three years after this war, known as the Kin-strife.  His eldest son Ornendil had died at Castamir's hands, and he was succeeded by his second son, Aldamir.

	Meaning:
	'People of the Stars'
	The name given to the Elves by the Vala Orom&#235; when he first found them wandering in the starlight of Cuivi&#233;nen.  At first, the name was applied to all Elves, but after the summons of the Valar, it came to be used only of the peoples who followed the summons and began the Great Journey.The Three Kindreds of the Eldar were the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri.  All of the Vanyar and Noldor went to Aman (though many of the Noldor later returned to Middle-earth with F&#235;anor).Many of the Teleri also journeyed to Valinor, but twice a host of this people turned away from the Journey in Middle-earth; these two kindreds are called &#218;manyar, the Eldar not of Aman. The first of these were the Nandor, who turned aside east of the Misty Mountains, and travelled down the River Anduin.  The second, the Sindar, tarried in Beleriand seeking their lord, Elw&#235; Singollo.

Eldarion

	The heir of Aragorn
	Timeline:

	Not certainly known.  Extant during the early centuries of the Fourth Age.
	Race:
	Men
	Division:
	D&#250;nedain
	Pronunciation:
	e'ldahree-on
	Meaning:
	(?descendant) of the Eldar
	Titles:
	King of the Reunited Kingdom
	AragornElessarArwenEvenstarELDARIONUnnamedsisters
	The son of Aragorn II Elessar and Arwen Evenstar; almost nothing is known of his life, but that he became King of the Reunited Kingdom after the death of his father in IV 120.
	For such an important character, almost nothing is known of Eldarion's life or deeds.  Almost the only definite statement about him came from his father, who commented that he was 'full-ripe for kingship' in The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen (given in Appendix A I (v) to The Lord of the Rings).  Aragorn's ancestors had tended to take over their duties as Chieftain at about the age of ninety: if Eldarion followed this pattern, this would place his birth in the years around IV 30.
	Eldarion inherited his Kingdom in a manner that recalled the ancient traditions of N&#250;menor: his father Aragorn Elessar gave him the tokens of his rule, and then gave up his life willingly, as his mighty ancestors had done thousands of years before.  The new King's mother Arwen left him to rule alone, passing away to the now-empty land of L&#243;rien, where her long life also came to an end.  As well as being the Heir of Isildur and High King, his descent from Elrond through Arwen made Eldarion the lord of the remaining Elf-lands of Middle-earth.  This fact seems to be the source of his name, which apparently means 'Descendant of the Eldar'.
	What these great titles meant in practice, cannot now be known.  There are references in the History of Middle-earth that make it all but certain that he left descendants to rule after him, but apart from these, no details of Eldarion's time as High King are recorded.

	Elf-man1
	ElrondCelebr&#237;anELLADANElrohirArwen
	In the one hundred and thirtieth year of the Third Age, Celebr&#237;an the wife of Elrond bore twin sons.  Dark-haired and grey-eyed, only those that knew them well could tell them apart.  The first of the twins was named Elladan, 'Elf-Man' as a token of his ancestry; he was descended not only from the royal houses of the Noldor and the Sindar, but also from the Houses of Hador and B&#235;or of the Edain.Many centuries later, the twins' mother Celebr&#237;an went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, Galadriel, in the land of L&#243;rien.  In the Redhorn Pass, she was captured by orcs, and tortured in their dens.  Elladan rode with his brother to rescue her, but by the time they reached her she had received a poisonous wound.  Though their father healed her, she would not remain in Middle-earth, and sailed into the West the following year.  After this loss, Elladan and his brother Elrohir were filled with hatred of the orcs, often riding against them with the Northern D&#250;nedain.In the early part of the War of the Ring, the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the Fellowship, but later they took a more active part.  When Halbarad rode to Aragorn's aid with the Grey Company, Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them.  They followed Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead, fought with him at Pelargir, and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where they fought with stars bound to their brows.After the War of the Ring, little is known of the brothers' fate.  They returned to their father's house at Rivendell, and remained there even after he had passed across the Sea.  Like their sister Arwen, the sons of Elrond Half-elven were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the Undying Lands, or remain there and become Mortal as Men.  Elladan had such a bond with his brother that they must surely have chosen alike, but what choice they made in the end can never now be known.

	One of the greatest Elves in the history of Middle-earth, Elrond was born at the Havens of Sirion late in the First Age.  During their sack, he and his brother Elros were taken captive by the Sons of F&#235;anor, but Maglor took pity on them and released them.  When they were rescued, Elrond was found playing in a cave beneath a waterfall, and so received his name.Both of Elrond's parents were half-elven, and after the War of Wrath he was given a choice; whether to be counted amongst the kindred of Elves or of Men.  He chose the Firstborn, and remained in Lindon with High King Gil-galad.After the invasion of Eriador by Sauron in the mid-Second Age, Elrond founded a refuge there in a deep hidden valley; this was named Imladris, or Rivendell in the Common Speech.  After Sauron's defeat by Tar-Minastir of N&#250;menor, Elrond remained in Rivendell, where he prospered with the aid of the Great Ring, Vilya.Elrond played a great part in the histories of the Second and Third Ages; he marched with Gil-galad and Elendil to the War of the Last Alliance, and was a leading member of the White Council.  At the time of the Council of Elrond in 3018 (Third Age), he had dwelt in Middle-earth for some 6,500 years.
	Notes
	1
	In a letter of 1958, Tolkien gives a very detailed derivation of Elrond.  When the Sons of F&#235;anor attacked the Exiles of Gondolin, Elrond and his brother Elros (both at that time small children) were carried off, but later found near a waterfall; Elrond was discovered in a cave behind the fall - hence 'Elf of the Cave'.  However, in a much later letter (1972), Tolkien interprets the name 'Vault of Stars', and Christopher Tolkien gives the similar 'Star-dome' in his Appendix to The Silmarillion.  Whether it was Tolkien's intention to change the derivation of Elrond, or whether the older story simply slipped his mind, cannot now be known.

	Notes

	'Elf of the Spray' is based on an old story of Elros' childhood, in which he was carried off by the Sons of F&#235;anor with his brother Elrond, but they were later found near a forest waterfall.  Elros was playing in the water, hence his name, which relates to the spray of the waterfall.  It should be said, though, that it isn't clear whether Tolkien meant this story to stand.  In the Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien interprets Elros quite differently, as 'Star-foam'.

Elven-rings
	[elvenrings.txt]
	The magical rings of the Elves of Eregion
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Made in the years leading up to c. II 1590. With the destruction of the One Ring in III 3019, the Elven-rings lost their power.
	Origins:
	Made by Celebrimbor and the M&#237;rdain of Eregion
	Race:
	Elves
	The magical rings made by Celebrimbor and the M&#237;rdain of Eregion in the middle years of the Second Age, made unwittingly under the secret guidance and tutelage of Sauron.  Most famous among them were the Three Rings of the Elves, Narya, Nenya and Vilya, the Rings of Fire, Water and Air.  These were the only three made outside the influence of Sauron, though they too fell under the power of his One Ring.After Sauron made his Ring, he invaded the lands of the M&#237;rdain for the recovery of the Elven-rings.  His armies overwhelmed Eregion, and he gathered most of the rings to himself, but four of the Great Rings were lost to him.  One (later known as the Ring of Thr&#243;r) was held by Durin III, King of the impregnable Dwarf-city of Khazad-d&#251;m in the Misty Mountains. Nenya the Ring of Water  was carried eastward from Eregion by Galadriel, who crossed the mountains and settled in the land of L&#243;rien.  Narya and Vilya had already been sent into the north by Celebrimbor, and were in the safekeeping of High King Gil-galad.Galadriel kept her Elven-ring throughout the later years of the Second Age, and the duration of the Third.  Gil-galad gave his rings to lords in his service - Narya to C&#237;rdan at the Grey Havens, and Vilya to Elrond, who used it to found a haven of his own against Sauron in the midst of Eriador - Imladris, that Men came to call Rivendell. C&#237;rdan, too, passed on his Ring, to a Grey stranger who sailed into his havens out of the West, who would come to be known in later legends as Mithrandir, or Gandalf.With the destruction of Sauron's One Ring in the last years of the Third Age, all the other Elven-rings lost their power, including the Three.  Those who had borne their power through the ages since their forging left Middle-earth together on the White Ship: Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Three Rings.

	The first Elves awoke by Cuivi&#233;nen, the Water of Awakening in the far east of Middle-earth, long Ages before the Rising of the Sun or Moon.  Unlike Men, the Elves were not subject to illness or death, and at the time of the Lord of the Rings, there were still at least two Elves in Aman who had awoken by Cuivi&#233;nen in the first days; Ingw&#235;, Lord of the Vanyar, and Olw&#235;, brother of King Elu Thingol.Origins and Early HistoryIn the far eastern land of Cuivi&#233;nen, on the shores of the Inland Sea of Helcar and beneath the mountains of the Orocarni, the Elves awoke under the starlight of the Years of the Trees.  The Valar at first knew nothing of their coming, but they were soon discovered by the spies of Melkor, who sent his creatures to watch them and harrass them.How long they existed in this perilous and unprotected state is not known, but the legends of those times, of the Hunter and of a dark Rider, were preserved in Valinor by the Eldar that came there.  It is known that many of the ancient Elves were captured by Melkor and imprisoned in Utumno - it is generally thought that these hapless beings were the origins of the race of Orcs.The Valar discovered that the Elves had awoken when Orom&#235;, hunting in the lands of Middle-earth, heard their singing voices.  He named them Eldar, the People of the Stars, but the Elves' own name for their kind was Quendi, those who speak with voices. Because of the horrors of Melkor, many of the Elves were at first suspicious of the Vala, but (after briefly returning to Valinor to tell the other Valar of his discovery) he remained with them and protected them for a time.Concerned for the safety of the Elves in Middle-earth, which was at that time under the control of Melkor, the Valar left Valinor and made war against the Dark Lord: this was the Battle of the Powers, which saw Melkor taken as captive back to Valinor.The Great JourneyAfter the defeat of Melkor, the Valar debated the fate of the Elves - whether they should be left to dwell in Middle-earth, or brought to Valinor to be kept under the direct protection of the Valar.  It was decided to bring them to the land of the Valar, and Orom&#235; was sent back to Cuivi&#233;nen to summon them.When he returned, though, he found that the Elves feared the Valar, and were reluctant to make the journey.  Three ambassadors were chosen, Ingw&#235;, Finw&#235; and Elw&#235;, to travel to Aman with Orom&#235;, and help the Elves decide on their course.  These three were filled with awe by what they saw there, and by the light of the Two Trees, and counselled their people to follow the summons.The followers of Ingw&#235;, and most of the peoples of Finw&#235; and Elw&#235; agreed, and set out on the Great Journey westwards across the wide lands of Middle-earth.  These were the peoples later known as the Three Kindreds, the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri.  Not all the Elves obeyed the summons; those who refused are known as Avari, the Unwilling2.Orom&#235; led the peoples of the Three Kindreds out of the east of Middle-earth.  The Vanyar were the least numerous, and the most eager to reach Aman, and they came first on the Journey, followed by the Noldor of Finw&#235;.The Teleri, led by Elw&#235; and his brother Olw&#235;, were the greatest host, and many were uncertain and doubtful.  Not a few of these people left the Journey and remained in Middle-earth3.  The most notable of those who turned from the Journey were the Nandor, who were led away down the Vales of Anduin by Lenw&#235;.At last, the Vanyar and the Noldor reached the shores of the Great Sea, in the regions between the Bay of Balar and the Firth of Drengist (regions later known, at least for the most part, as the Falas).  Ulmo brought a great island to the shores, and on it transported the Elves to Aman.The Teleri were the hindcomers, though, and arrived in Beleriand too late to embark on Ulmo's island.  They dwelt for a while on the banks of the Gelion in eastern Beleriand, but later spread to the shores.  In this time, two events of historical importance occurred - their lord Elw&#235; was lost for a time in Nan Elmoth, and they encountered Oss&#235;, a Maia of the Sea.Many of the Teleri wished to remain in Beleriand, some to seek for their lost lord, and others because of desires stirred in their hearts by Oss&#235;.  When the time came for Ulmo to return to Beleriand to take the Teleri to Valinor, then, many of them remained behind. These people became known in after years as the Sindar, the Grey-elves, and those who dwelt by the shores under the lordship of C&#237;rdan became known as the Falathrim.Melkor Chained: Three Ages of BlissNow came three ages of glory and bliss for the Elves, both east and west of the Great Sea. In Valinor, the Vanyar and the Noldor, and those of the Teleri who completed the Journey, dwelt with the Valar and learned from them.  They dwelt in the jewelled city of Tirion in the Pass of Light, and at the Swanhaven of Alqualond&#235;, and beneath the tower of Avall&#243;n&#235; on the Lonely Isle of Tol Eress&#235;a.  While the Two Trees still gave light to the realm of the Valar, three ages passed, and the Elves of Valinor became the wisest and noblest of all the Children of Il&#250;vatar.Meanwhile, in Beleriand, the Sindar dwelt beneath starlight.  While most of Middle-earth still slept, awaiting the coming of the Sun and Moon, Melian the Maia brought life to the forests and plains of Beleriand under Thingol's rule, and Orom&#235; would still ride at times across the darkling lands.The Nature of the ElvesBoth Elves and Men are the Children of Il&#250vatar, and so have much in common, but there are also great differences between the two peoples.  Of these, the most significant is that Elves are 'immortal', at least while the World lasts; they do not suffer ageing1 or disease, and if they are slain or wither with grief, they are reincarnated in the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.Although, unlike Men, the Elves must remain in the world until its ending, they are not bound to Middle-earth.  They may if they wish take the straight road, and sail into the Uttermost West, a road that is barred to mortals.Elves also have far clearer sight and perception than Men; they are naturally aware of many things that are hidden from the Younger Children, but these gifts are not without limit.ReligionThe Elves never had any distinct 'religion' in the sense that Men would understand the word; indeed, the High Elves had travelled to Valinor and lived with the Valar (or 'gods') themselves for many ages before Men came into the world.Of all the Valar, they most revered Varda Elent&#225;ri, the spouse of Manw&#235; and Lady of the Stars.  In Middle-earth, they called her Elbereth, Star-Queen, and sang to her across the wide ocean Belegaer.  Great respect was also given to Ulmo, especially during the First Age when he aided the Elves against Morgoth.
	Notes
	1
	More correctly, Elves don't suffer ageing in the same way as Men.  In fact they do age, as Tolkien makes clear in his Letters.  There, he says, 'The Elves were sufficiently longeval to be called by Man 'immortal'.  But they were not unageing or unwearying' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 245, dated 1963).
	2
	This is the point where the term Eldar acquires its special meaning.  Before the beginning of the Great Journey, it was applied to all Elves.  After the Three Kindreds set out, it came to be used only for Elves belonging to these three peoples.
	3
	These Elves who turned aside from the Journey founded peoples and lands of their own.  The Wood-elves of Mirkwood and the Galadhrim of L&#243;rien were descended from them, for example.

	For three ages after the departure of the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri to Aman, the Elves who inhabited Beleriand comprised that part of the Telerin people who remained in Middle-earth, known as the Sindar or Grey-elves after their king, Thingol Greycloak of Doriath.At the rising of the Moon in the beginning of the First Age, many of the Noldor returned to Beleriand from Aman to make war on Morgoth.  While there was some enmity between the Sindar and the Noldor (especially the Sons of F&#235;anor), the two peoples lived together in the face of their common foe, Morgoth Bauglir.Finally, a small part of the Nandor, kin of the Sindar who had turned aside from the westward journey east of the Misty Mountains, entered the land of Ossiriand during the First Age. Though these people, called the Laiquendi or Green-elves, played little part in the wars against Morgoth, they are accounted a part of the Elves of Beleriand.

	1
	In Appendix B of the The Lord of the Rings, we're told that the early Second Age saw the migration of many of the Sindar from Lindon, and that some of these travellers founded forest-realms.  We're also told explicitly that 'Thranduil, king in the north of Greenwood the Great [Mirkwood], was one of these.'  However, there are accounts in Unfinished Tales of an earlier king of the Elves of Mirkwood, Thranduil's father Oropher, who was lost in the War of the Last Alliance.  These accounts can be reconciled if we imagine Thranduil travelling east from Lindon with Oropher, helping to found a kingdom in Greenwood the Great, but not in fact becoming its king until the death of his father more than two thousand years later.

	The Wood-elves were limited to the northeastern parts of the forest at the end of the Second Age, but this had not always been the case.  Their realm was originally founded on and around the hill of Amon Lanc, in the south of the forest.  The Elves moved northward at least four times in their history, at first to move away from the influence of Khazad-d&#251;m and L&#243;rien.  In the Third Age, Sauron came to their old home of Amon Lanc and built Dol Guldur there, and Thranduil was forced to lead his people from their then home in the Mountains of Mirkwood to the far north of the wood, where he delved an underground fortress.

	A short-lived Elven culture that grew up in the lands around the Mouths of Sirion during the last days of the First Age.  Its people were Elves that had fled from the destruction of the great realms of Beleriand, especially Gondolin and Doriath.  It was itself destroyed, not by Morgoth, but by the remaining Sons of F&#235;anor who sought the Silmaril of Elwing, who dwelt with the Elves of Sirion.

Elves of the Falas
	[elvesofthefalas.txt]
	The coastland Elves of Beleriand
	In ancient days, the Telerin Elves dwelt for long years in Beleriand, and they learned much from Oss&#235;, a Maia of the Sea.  When Oss&#235;'s master Ulmo conducted the most part of the Teleri into the West, Oss&#235; persuaded some few to remain behind.  They settled on Beleriand's western shores, building themselves Havens at Brithombar and Eglarest.  C&#237;rdan was their leader, and they were known as the Falathrim, or Elves of the Falas, the first builders and sailors of ships in Middle-earth's history.
	After the Return of the Noldor, the Elves of the Falas became fast in friendship with the Deep Elves.  With Finrod's aid, the Havens of the Falas were strengthened and rebuilt.  They fought beside the Noldor, too: in the Dagor Bragollach, their mariners rescued High King Fingon from overwhelming hordes in Hithlum, and they went to the aid of Fingon again at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
	After the disaster of the Nirnaeth, many of the survivors fled back to the Havens of the Falas, but they were not safe there for long.  A year after the great defeat, Morgoth sent his creatures to besiege them, and both the Havens were overthrown.  Most of the Elves of the Falas perished in the fall of the Havens, or were captured, but C&#237;rdan escaped.  With his surviving followers, he sailed southwards, and settled for a time on the Isle of Balar.  He maintained a haven there for many years, before removing once again to Lindon, where he dwelt at the Grey Havens with, doubtless, a remnant of the Falathrim.

	Division:

	A Sindarin people occupying the land of the Falas in western Beleriand, on the shores of Belegaer. C&#237;rdan the Shipwright was their lord, and their great cities were the Havens of Brithombar and Eglarest.The Elves of the Havens enjoyed peaceful relations with all the Elves of Beleriand, and were particularly closely allied with the people of Nargothrond.  As one of the most remote peoples from Morgoth's forces in Angband, the other Elvish lords would often send their children to the Elves of the Havens for safekeeping.After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Brithombar and Eglarest were besieged and taken by Morgoth's armies, and most of the Elves were slain or imprisoned.  Some few, including C&#237;rdan and the young Ereinion Gil-galad, who was at that time lodging with the people of the Havens, sailed south to safety on the Isle of Balar.At the beginning of the Second Age, C&#237;rdan sailed east to found the Grey Havens on the Gulf of Lh&#251;n, and the remnant of the Elves of the Havens must surely have accompanied him.

	1
	Elwing's mother Nimloth had, as far as we know, pure Sindarin blood.  The line of her father Dior, though, contained other strains; his grandmother Melian had been a Maia, and his father Beren was a mortal Man.  Working back to her great-grandparents, Elwing was actually five-eighths Sinda, one quarter Mortal and one eighth Maia.
	2
	Elwing's name, 'Star-spray' comes from the starlight glinting on the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath, at her father's house in Ossiriand, on the night she was born.

Its water was black, and carried a curse that gave the river its name - any person coming into contact with its enchanted water immediately fell into a long, deep sleep.About halfway along its length, the Enchanted River flowed across the Elf-path that led west to east through Mirkwood to Thranduil's halls, and it seems that a ferry was maintained there, presumably for the use of the Wood-elves.  At least, Bilbo and the Dwarves found a boat kept on the eastern bank of the River, which they used to cross it on their journey to Erebor.

	Notes
	1
	In the years after their founding, Enedwaith lay between Arnor to the north and Gondor to the south, and so the people who lived here were known as the 'middle-folk'.  Though Enedwaith did not belong to either Kingdom, it was jointly administered by the D&#250;nedain, and the Wild Men who lived here ultimately did so under their control.  Tolkien goes so far as to hint that, in the earliest days of the Two Kingdoms, Enedwaith was considered to fall within the boundaries of Gondor.

	The ending '-ing' has at least two possible meanings in this context, though the diminuitive 'little Ents' seems the most appropriate.  It might also imply that the Entings belonged to the people of the Ents (as in the Eorlings, those who belonged to the people of Eorl).

	The mates of the Ents, who had their gardens in the regions later known as the Brown Lands. When Sauron blasted that region, the Entwives escaped into the wilds of Middle-earth and were lost to the Ents (or so the Ents themselves believed).
	Notes
	1
	It should be said that the fate of the Entwives was never resolved with certainty, but the signs are not hopeful. Tolkien's clearest statement on the matter is to be found in his Letters: 'I think that in fact the Entwives had disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance (Second Age 3429 - 3441)...' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 144, dated 1954).  This is less definite than it might appear, because he goes on to suggest that some might have fled into the east, and finally simply states of their fate, 'I don't know.'

The Entwood was their name for it in their own tongue, but by the time of the War of the Ring, any meaning this name might have held was long forgotten.  To the Rohirrim, the Ents of the Entwood were no more than fanciful tales, until they were roused in anger against Saruman and helped to rescue the Riders of Rohan from his forces.

	The Dark Elf
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Born before the beginning of the First Age; slain c.I 345
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Sindar
	Family:
	Said to have been of the kin of King Thingol

	E&#214;L
	Aredhel
	Maeglin
	Originally a member of the royal house of Doriath, and kin to Thingol himself, E&#246;l was unhappy in his native land. When the Girdle of Melian was placed around the forests of Doriath, E&#246;l took his leave, and went to dwell in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth, east of his homeland.E&#246;l was a skilful craftsman and master swordsmith.  Among his greatest works were two swords made from the iron of a meteorite, Anglachel and Anguirel.  Anglachel he gave to Thingol as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth, and it would later become the sword borne by T&#250;rin Turambar.  E&#246;l's smithcraft was especially admired by the Dwarves, and he shared a rare friendship with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains.One day in the early fourth century of the First Age, E&#246;l came upon a gleaming white figure in his woods. This was Aredhel, the sister of Turgon, who had travelled out of Gondolin and become lost.  E&#246;l used his enchantments to draw her deeper into the wood and ensnare her.  She became his wife, and bore him a son, Maeglin.One midsummer, many years later, E&#246;l travelled into the Blue Mountains to feast with the Dwarves of Nogrod, and returned home to find that his wife and son had left two days earlier.  Mounting a horse, he gave chase, and eventually discovered them at the ford called the Brithiach.  Realizing that Aredhel was returning to Gondolin with his son, E&#246;l followed them.  He found his way to the Dry River, and that secret way led him to the gates of Gondolin itself.  There he was captured and taken to the King.Turgon at first welcomed E&#246;l as a kinsman, but under the King's law one who had found the way to the Hidden City was not permitted to leave, on pain of death.  Enraged at the loss of his freedom, E&#246;l chose death, for himself and his son, and cast a poisoned javelin at Maeglin.  Aredhel took the dart instead, and soon passed away.  In this way E&#246;l achieved the end he had sought; in punishment for his crime, the Gondolindrim cast him over the dark cliffs of the Caragd&#251;r.
	Notes
	1
	The name E&#246;l goes back to the earliest forms of the Silmarillion myths, but it seems to have emerged from Tolkien's imagination fully formed, without any particular meaning.  Long after its first appearance, he wrote that it was 'Another name from prim[itive] FG - meaningless then and now...', and added, 'It isn't really absolutely necessary that names should be significant'.  These notes come from The War of the Jewels (volume 11 of The History of Middle-earth); 'FG' here is a reference of an old form of the story of the Fall of Gondolin, given in volume 2 of the same series.

	III 2991 - IV 63 (93 years)King of Rohan from 15 March III 3019 (reigned 65 years)
	Race:
	Men

	House of Eorl
	Pronunciation:
	earme'r1
	Meaning:
	Probably a compound meaning 'horse-famous'2
	Titles:
	&#201;adig, King of the Mark, King of Rohan, Lord of the Mark, Third Marshal of Riddermark
	&#201;omundTh&#233;odwyn&#201;OMERLoth&#237;riel&#201;owynElfwine
	The son of &#201;omund of Eastfold and Th&#233;odwyn, the sister of King Th&#233;oden.  While still a young man of just twenty-six, &#201;omer the King's nephew was made Third Marshal of Riddermark, and took command of the Riders of Eastfold.  The days of his youth were harsh ones for Rohan; its people were imperilled by Orcs out of the north, while a certain Gr&#237;ma son of G&#225;lm&#243;d, later found to be a spy of Saruman, gained influence over the King.On 25 February III 3019, Rohan suffered its greatest blow to date; at a skirmish that would become known as the First Battle of the Fords of Isen, Th&#233;oden's son and heir Th&#233;odred was slain by Saruman's forces, leaving &#201;omer - who was not at the battle - as the natural heir to Rohan's throne.  It was five days later that the tide began to turn in Rohan's favour, when &#201;omer came across three strangers travelling through the fields of the Mark.  These strangers were Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and from &#201;omer's wise decision to aid these three came Rohan's ultimate victory.Because of this, some days later, Gandalf came to Edoras and healed the King of his malaise.  The Rohirrim went to war, and though they were defeated at the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, they held their own at the Battle of the Hornburg and, with the aid of the Ents of Fangorn Forest, defeated Saruman's armies.  Then &#201;omer rode with his King to the aid of Minas Tirith, where they fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  There Th&#233;oden met his end, and granted &#201;omer the Kingship, first of the Third Line of the Kings of Rohan.At the time of the great victories of that year, &#201;omer was still just twenty-eight years old.  He would rule the Rohirrim for another sixty-five years, through which he maintained a great friendship with Gondor.  Such was the plenty and peace of his reign that he was given the surname &#201;adig, 'Blessed'.  He was succeeded by his son Elfwine.
	Notes
	1
	The first syllable of &#201;omer's name is pronounced approximately like the English word 'ear'.
	2
	The &#233;o- element of &#201;omer's name is surely 'horse', but -mer is less certain.  It is most likely derived from Old English maer, meaning 'famous, glorious, heroic'.

	Notes
	1
	The diphthong &#233;o is effectively extinct in English, and pronunciation is doubly difficult since Tolkien's example, the name Theobald, is also rare.   The vowel-sound of the word 'ear' comes close to the correct pronunciation.Theobald, incidentally, is a real Old English name, of the kind that might have been used by the Rohirrim, though they would likely have rendered it Th&#233;odbold.  It combines the elements th&#233;od 'people' and bald 'bold'.

In the south of Dor-l&#243;min, the Ered L&#243;min met the range of the Ered Wethrin, and so walled off Hithlum and its lesser lands from Beleriand to the south.
	The name Ered L&#243;min means 'Echoing Mountains', but the origin of the name is uncertain.  According to some sources, it refers to the echoes of the great cry of Morgoth as he returned into Middle-earth with Ungoliant before F&#235;anor's own return.  According to others, it was merely in the nature of these mountains to produce great echoes.  Whatever the origin of the name, it was clearly shared by the land of Dor-l&#243;min, that lay to the southeast of these mountains.

	Notes
	1
	It's usually assumed that Eregion was founded by Celebrimbor, the grandson of F&#235;anor, but Tolkien never explicitly states this.  In the published works, his only definite comment on Eregion's foundation is from the appropriate entry in the Tale of Years (The Lord of the Rings Appendix B): '750 Eregion founded by the Noldor.'  This is a curiously general statement: Celebrimbor's history is well developed in the book, and we would expect his name to appear here if he was Eregion's founder.In Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth, we glimpse a possible explanation. This makes it clear that, at least for a time, Tolkien considered Eregion to have been founded by Galadriel and Celeborn before they settled in L&#243;rien.  It isn't clear to what extent this should be taken as 'historical' fact, and it isn't completely consistent with the statement in The Lord of the Rings (because Celeborn wasn't of the Noldor), but it remains an interesting possibility.

Its attendants would set fire to their Beacon when they saw a flame on Nardol, far to the east, and their own Beacon-fire would be answered by that on the peak of Min-rimmon to the west.  All these Beacon hills lay among the White Mountains as they came down into the plains of An&#243;rien, the fief of Gondor that lay on Rohan's borders.

	The first words of the Ainulindal&#235; introduce us to the name Eru: 'There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Il&#250;vatar...'.  This wording can be seen as suggesting that Eru is the 'true' name of the supreme being, but in fact this doesn't seem to be the case - Eru is just Elvish for 'The One'.

	A major tributary of the Sirion, which rose in the dark heights of the Ered Gorgoroth, and flowed southwestward to meet the Sirion on the western borders of Doriath.  It marked the boundary between the forests of Neldoreth and Region.
	Notes
	1
	In his Appendix to The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien explains the element esgal- as 'screen, hiding', but doesn't explain why this would apply to the Esgalduin.  It would be natural to associate the name with Doriath's being known as the 'Hidden Kingdom', but in fact this does not seem to be correct.  Actually, the Esgalduin seems to have taken its name from the dense forests it ran through, whose branches and leaves veiled the river from sight.  This interpretation comes from The Etymologies (The History of Middle-earth Volume 5, The Lost Road and Other Writings III).

Eye of Mordor
	[eyeofmordor.txt]
	The piercing sight of Sauron
	From his high place in Barad-d&#251;r, Sauron looked out across the lands of Middle-earth through the Window of the Eye.  His power of vision was very great, and he could watch events unfolding hundreds of miles from his Dark Tower.  He was not all-seeing, though: he could only study one thing at a time, and the sight of his Eye could be distracted, or blinded by shadow.  It was through these failings that the Wise were able to send Sauron's Ring into the heart of his own Dark Land.
	The powers of the Eye of Mordor seem very similar to those of the palant&#237;ri, the Seeing-stones, and it is perhaps no coincidence that Sauron held one of these under his control.  There are other indications of a connection between the two.  For example, when Aragorn used a palant&#237;r to reveal himself to Sauron, '...the Eye turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword a stern and kingly face it saw...' (The Return of the King VI 2, The Land of Shadow).  So, it is clear that the power of the Eye was somehow connected to the Ithil-stone in Sauron's power, but whether the stone granted him the power of the Eye, or merely enhanced his own natural powers, is open to question.

	Written some time in the Third Age1
	&quot;But long ago he rode away,and where he dwelleth none can say;for into darkness fell his starin Mordor where the shadows are.&quot;
	From The Fall of Gil-Galad,as translated by Bilbo Bagginsin The Fellowship of the Ring I 11 A Knife in the Dark
	The lay that tells of the loss of Ereinion Gil-galad in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r at the end of the War of the Last Alliance.  Sam sings the first lines of it in the The Lord of the Rings.
	Little is known of the lay itself.  According to Aragorn, it was originally written in 'an ancient tongue' (presumably Quenya), but Bilbo Baggins later translated it into the Common Tongue, and taught it to Samwise Gamgee in his younger days.  It seems to have told the story of the War of the Last Alliance, at least to the point where Gil-galad aided in the overthrow of Sauron, and was himself slain.  Its contents, though, are largely unknown: Sam confirms that it was a long poem, but apart from three introductory stanzas, the text of the lay is lost.
	Notes
	1
	The Fall of Gil-galad refers to Gil-galad's loss at the end of the Second Age, and Bilbo's translation is recited by Sam Gamgee on 6 October III 3018, near the end of the Third, so it must have originated in that Age.  The fact that it refers to the War of the Last Alliance as 'long ago' suggests that it was written some considerable time after the events it describes.

Fallohides
	[fallohides.txt]
	The northern branch of Hobbit-kind
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Entered Eriador in c.III 1150; merged with other Hobbit-kinds by the end of the Third Age
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Meaning:
	Apparently from Old English faluh&#253;d or some similar construct, meaning 'pale-skin'
	One of three original divisions of hobbit-kind, along with the Harfoots and Stoors. The Fallohides were the least numerous of the three branches, and originally dwelt in the northern parts of Middle-earth.The Nature of the FallohidesIn appearance, Fallohides were taller and slimmer of build than the other Hobbits, with some growing to four feet or more in height. Both their skin and their hair tended to be fair, and no Fallohide ever grew a beard.Fallohidish culture was much more open to outside influence than that of the Stoors or Harfoots; they were friendlier with the other races of Middle-earth than their cousins, especially the Elves.  Perhaps because of this, they were skilled in both song and speech.While the other two branches of hobbit-kind were pastoral and rustic in nature, the Fallohides retained a hunting tradition, and so were naturally bolder and more inquisitive than their relatives, but less gifted in the arts of farming and agriculture.The History of the FallohidesThe Fallohides seem to have dwelt originally on the upper reaches of the River Anduin, in the region where the Greylin and the Langwell flowed into the Great River.  It is likely that they mixed with the ancestors of the Rohirrim at this time, for the Northmen also dwelt in this region, and this is likely the origin of the legend of the holbytlan found in Rohan.At the end of the first millennium of the Third Age, evil things began to stir in the east of Middle-earth, and many peoples, including the ancestral Hobbits, began to travel westward across the Misty Mountains.  The first Hobbits to enter Eriador were the Harfoots; the Fallohides deserted their northern homes in around 1150 (Third Age), and crossed the Mountains to the north of Rivendell, at the sources of the River Hoarwell.The tribes of the Fallohidish Hobbits travelled slowly down the course of the Hoarwell, and westward across Eriador.  They eventually settled in the region around Bree, in c.1300 (Third Age), where their adventurous and intrepid natures made them natural leaders of the other Hobbits they found there.  It was presumably at about this time that the three strains of Hobbits began to mix freely for the first time.Three hundred years later (in the year 1601 of the Third Age), two Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, travelled westward again from Bree with their followers and crossed the Bridge of Stonebows (later the Brandywine Bridge). They settled in the empty land that they found there and were granted it by King Argeleb II of Arthedain, in whose realm it lay.  This was the land that was to become known as the Shire.As the centuries passed, the three distinct strains of the Hobbits gradually began to disappear as they mingled with one another in the Shire.  Nonetheless, there were families that retained a strong line of Fallohidish blood, and the impetuosity that went with it.  At the time of the War of the Ring, the Fallohidish line was still well represented in the families of the Tooks and the Brandybucks.

	Younger son of Steward Denethor II of Gondor, and brother to Boromir of the Company of the Ring.  He fought in the Battle of the Pelennor, and was rewarded after the installation of Aragorn II Elessar with the princedom of Ithilien.
	Notes
	1
	The -mir ending of Faramir's name is almost certainly 'jewel' or 'precious thing', but Fara- is much more difficult to translate.  The Elvish root far- means 'sufficient' or 'adequate', so it may be that the brothers Boromir and Faramir have names related to their father's attitude toward them.  As Denethor's favourite son, Boromir was perhaps the 'faithful jewel', while the less favoured Faramir was merely the 'sufficient jewel'.  These speculations, of course, belong to the realm of guesswork, since Tolkien makes no definitive statement about the names' origins.

	Title&nbsp;of:
	Durin the Deathless and six other unnamed Dwarves
	The seven progenitors of the Dwarven race, created by Aul&#235; the Smith long years before the awakening of the Elves.  They were granted life by Il&#250;vatar, and set to sleep in Middle-earth until the coming the Eldar.  Durin the Deathless was the eldest of their number.
	Notes
	1
	Though the Silmarillion is not specific about the awakening of the Dwarves, we can glimpse the reason why in the late essay Of Dwarves and Men (in The History of Middle-earth Volume 12, The Peoples of Middle-earth).  Tolkien notes there that the Dwarves knew the details of their awakening, but kept them secret.  It's logical, then, that the Elves who originated the Silmarillion couldn't have known where the Fathers of the Dwarves had awoken.In the same essay, though, we are told where three of the seven Fathers awoke.  The eldest and most famous of them, Durin the Deathless, awoke at Mount Gundabad in the northern Misty Mountains.  Two more, the unnamed ancestors of the Firebeard and Broadbeam clans, were placed by Aul&#235; in the Blue Mountains (and there presumably founded Nogrod and Belegost). The other Fathers awoke in pairs in two other locations, a thousand miles or more to the east of the Misty Mountains.

	&nbsp;&#149; Mearas
	Eorl's father L&#233;od was a tamer of horses among the &#201;oth&#233;od, who captured this wild white horse while it was still a foal.  He tried to tame it himself, but when he attempted to mount it, it threw him and escaped.  So L&#233;od died, leaving a sixteen-year-old son, Eorl.  Eorl hunted the white horse, found it, and demanded that it give up its freedom in payment for the death of his father.  The horse agreed, and took the name that Eorl gave it: Felar&#243;f, a name said to mean 'very valiant' or 'very strong'.It was on Felar&#243;f that Eorl rode to the aid of Gondor and earned a famous victory, one that would lead Steward Cirion to grant them the wide empty land of Calenardhon, which would come to be called Rohan.  For more than thirty years afterwards, Felar&#243;f had the freedom of those wide grasslands, but a new invasion of Easterlings saw Eorl ride to battle once again.  In the Wold, the far northern reach of Rohan, Eorl and Felar&#243;f met their ends, and were laid together in a mound raised outside the gate of Edoras.Felar&#243;f was a very remarkable horse indeed.  It is even recorded that he could understand the speech of Men. He gave rise in turn to a race of wonderful horses, the Mearas, who according to tradition could only be ridden by the Lords of the Mark, Eorl's descendants.  It was from this line that Gandalf's horse Shadowfax came, making him a descendant of Felar&#243;f himself.

	A possible derivation appears in The Peoples of Middle-earth (The History of Middle-earth Vol. 12): XI The Shibboleth of F&#235;anor. Here, Finarfin is a contraction of Finw&#235; Arafinw&#235; adapted to the sounds of Sindarin.  The meaning would be 'Finw&#235;, noble Finw&#235;' (according to this source, Finw&#235; originally named each of his three sons after himself).It should be noted, though, that The Shibboleth of F&#235;anor dates from the late 1960's, suggesting that Tolkien invented this derivation 'after the event' - it appears (though this cannot be stated certainly) that the name came first, and its derivation followed years later.

	The second son of Finw&#235; and half-brother to F&#235;anor.  After F&#235;anor's death, his eldest son Maedhros should have become High King of the Noldor, but Maedhros repented his deeds at the Kinslaying and refused the title, which thus passed to Fingolfin.He ruled the lands to the northwest of Beleriand with his sons Fingon and Turgon, and dwelt behind the mountain fences of Hithlum during the long Siege of Angband.When Morgoth broke the Siege in the Dagor Bragollach, Fingolfin was prevented from sending immediate help to the other princes of the Noldor by the ferocity of the onslaught, but when heard of the extent of their defeat, he rode in anger to the doors of Angband and demanded single combat with Morgoth.  There they fought a mighty battle, but though Fingolfin wounded the Dark Lord, he could not prevail, and was finally crushed by Morgoth.  His body was saved, though, by Thorondor, who bore it to a peak in the Encircling Mountains.  Turgon came there and built a cairn over his father's remains.

	The first High King of the Noldor, and father to the three royal houses of that people.  Finw&#235; awoke with the first Elves at Cuivi&#233;nen, the Water of Awakening.  When the Valar summoned the Elves to dwell with them in Valinor, he was chosen, with Ingw&#235; and Elw&#235;, to travel there as ambassadors.  When he returned, he led the Noldor in their great westward journey across the lands of Middle-earth and the Great Sea to Aman.Under Finw&#235;'s rule the Noldor dwelt for at least three ages (about 9,000 years) in Valinor, and learned much from the Valar, especially Aul&#235; the Smith.  During this time, he dwelt in Tirion, but afterwards his eldest son F&#235;anor withdrew to his fortress of Formenos, and Finw&#235; went to dwell there also.After the Darkening of Valinor, Melkor stormed Formenos seeking the Silmarils, which were held in its vaults.  He slew Finw&#235; before its doors and stole the Jewels of F&#235;anor.  After his death, the kingship of the Noldor was briefly bestowed on his son F&#235;anor.
	Notes

	The interpretation 'skilled one' is based on an old name-element phin-, meaning 'nimbleness, skill'.  It does not appear to be related to fin-, meaning 'hair', which appears in many Elf-names.

	Turambar and the Foal&#243;k&#235;in The History of Middle-earth volume II, The Book of Lost Tales 2
	The more powerful of the two fundamental divisions of dragon-kind, who, as the name suggests, were able to breathe fire.  Glaurung, Ancalagon and Smaug were all fire-drakes.  The only explicit reference is in The Silmarillion (Of the Return of the Noldor); "&#133;Glaurung, the first of the Urul&#243;ki, the fire-drakes of the North, issued from Angband's gates by night."
	Smaug, the last of the truly powerful dragons, was slain by Bard in the late Third Age.  We can be sure that he was not the last of the fire-drakes, though, because Gandalf refers to fire-breathing dragons in the time before the War of the Ring, nearly eighty years after Smaug's death.  Tolkien even goes so far as to hint that some of these creatures might have survived to our own times.

	The Age of the Wars of Beleriand
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	I 1 to c.I 583
	First, and shortest by far, of the Four Ages chronicled by Tolkien.  Unlike the Second and Third Ages, there is no detailed chronicle of the events of the First Age, and so dates must be inferred from references in the text - hence many dates in this Age (including the year in which it ended) are necessarily approximate. The First Age began with the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the first rising of the Moon and the Sun, and the Awakening of Men in Hild&#243;rien.  It ended with the War of Wrath, the destruction of Beleriand and the final defeat of Morgoth.  The end of the First Age was marked by the return of many of the Noldor, accompanied also by many Sindarin Elves, into the West to dwell on Tol Eress&#235;a.Key Events of the First Age1Return of the Noldor; Dagor-nuin-Giliath; Awakening of Menc. 75Dagor Aglareb126Completion of Gondolinc. 305Arrival of Men in Beleriand455Dagor Bragollach465Beren and L&#250;thien achieve the Quest of the Silmaril471Nirnaeth Arnoediad495Sack of Nargothrond510Fall of Gondolinc. 583War of Wrath; defeat of MorgothFor a full chronicle of events from theFirst Age, see the Chronicle of Arda

	&nbsp;&#149; Anor
	A mysterious power claimed by Gandalf in the face of Durin's Bane.  It is nowhere else referred to, and so its particular meaning remains unclear.  Anor is the Sun, and so literally the 'flame of Anor' would be the light of the Sun, the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of Valinor.  Gandalf seems to be referring, then, to the power he gains as a servant of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness of the Balrog.

	From Gandalf's challenge to the Balrogfrom The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m
	Gandalf's name for the Balrog that dwelt in the depths of Moria, that he faced on the Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m, and ultimately defeated.  'Flame' is a reference to its nature as a fire-demon, while 'Ud&#251;n' was the name of Morgoth's oldest and greatest fortress in the north of the World, more commonly called Utumno, and the Balrog's ancient home.
	There is no direct connection between this 'Ud&#251;n' and the rounded valley to the northwest of Mordor with the same name.  There is an indirect connection, though: that region also took its name from the stronghold of Sauron's master.

Flight of the Noldor

	The journey of the Noldor out of Aman

	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Noldor
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Return of the Noldor2
	The self-imposed exile of the Noldor, who fled from Valinor in pursuit of Melkor and the Silmarils he had stolen.
	Notes
	1
	In The Silmarillion, there is almost no hint of a passage of time between the departure of the Noldor from Tirion, and their arrival in Middle-earth.  The only point where the length of the journey is mentioned is in 9 Of the Flight of the Noldor, where we're told that they had 'marched for a great while in the unmeasured night' (this was after the Darkening of Valinor, so 'night' here just means that they were marching in darkness).  The Noldor set out from the central regions of the World, and a very large number of them had to travel thousands of miles into the far north.  It's reasonable to assume that this journey must have taken at least several years.In fact, we have the Annals of Aman to give us some insight into this matter (in Morgoth's Ring, volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth).  There, the departure of the Noldor is dated 1495, and their arrival in Middle-earth is dated 1497.  These dates are given in Years of the Trees from their first planting, with each Year of the Trees being equivalent to about 9&#189; solar years.  The Flight ofthe Noldor from Aman into Middle-earth, then, took very roughly nineteen years to complete.
	2
	Whether the journey of the Noldor was a 'flight' or a 'return' is a matter of perspective.  To the Valar, and the Elves they left behind in Aman, the Noldor were fleeing into the dark east of the World.  To the Sindar and other Elves who had remained in the Hither Lands, it was the return of long-sundered kin out of the unknown west.

Fords of Aros
	[fordsofaros.txt]
	The crossings on the upper River Aros
	The River Aros had its sources in two streams that flowed southward out of the hills of Dorthonion.  Where those streams met, an ancient east-west road crossed the upper reaches of the river at a ford.  This was the place known as the Fords of Aros, or the Arossiach in Elvish.  The ford marked the boundary between two regions.  To the east was Himlad, and the other lands held by the sons of F&#235;anor.  To the west was the Silent Land of Dor D&#237;nen, and beyond it the perilous valley of Nan Dungortheb.
	The Fords of Aros seem to date back to the days before the beginning of the First Age, when the roads north of Doriath were safe to travel.  After the coming of Ungoliant, and the raising of the Girdle of Melian, the lands west of the Arossiach became a haunted and dangerous place, and in later years the Fords were only used by the bravest or most desperate travellers.

Fords of Poros

	The gateway to Ithilien
	Location:
	The crossing of the River Poros by the Harad Road, on the southern borders of Ithilien
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Crossings of Poros
	More often called the 'Crossings of Poros', the Fords marked the point where the Harad Road from Harad and South Gondor entered the lands of Gondor proper.  As such, their strategic importance was considerable, as attacking armies from the south had no choice but to cross the Poros at this point.The Fords first entered history in the year III 1944, when the enemies of Gondor made an alliance, and all attacked simultaneously, from the northeast and from the south.  It was left to the great general E&#228;rnil (later King E&#228;rnil II) to deal with the army of Harad approaching from the south.  Rather than defend the Fords (as no doubt the Haradrim expected he would), E&#228;rnil positioned his army some forty miles further north, in South Ithilien, and decimated the encroaching enemy1.Though Gondor survived that assault with great loss, the land was often threatened by the Haradrim. In III 2885, the fierce people of that southern land occupied South Gondor and attacked Ithilien across the Poros.  Steward T&#250;rin II was aided in his defence by King Folcwine of Rohan, whose twin sons Folcred and Fastred rode with his army.  These two northern armies forced the Haradrim back across the Fords and had the victory, but the sons of Folcwine both fell in that battle.The Rohirrim buried the twins in a great mound, after their custom, and that mound, the Haudh in Gwanur, guarded Gondor's southern boundaries for long years after.
	Notes
	1
	Unfortunately, there are few details of E&#228;rnil's victory.  All we know for certain is that he '...won a great victory in South Ithilien and destroyed the army of Harad that had crossed the River Poros' (Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth, III 2 (i) The Northmen and the Wainriders).  His tactic, presumably, was to ambush the Haradrim in Ithilien, and use the river to hamper their escape.  Sadly, though, Tolkien never completed the relevant text, so the details of the battle will never be known.

Forest of Fangorn
	[forestoffangorn.txt]
	The ancient forest beneath the southern Misty Mountains
	The deep, dark woodland that grew beneath the southern Misty Mountains, under the eastern flanks of that range.  Millennia before the War of the Ring, these woods had spread across the western lands of Middle-earth, but the forestry of the N&#250;men&#243;reans had seen them dwindle during the Second Age, and by the end of the Third, the Forest of Fangorn was the last large part of that old forest to survive, though not the only one.
	The forest took its name from the Elvish Fangorn, 'Treebeard', a reference to the old Ent who dwelt there.  The Ents had once walked freely in the western lands, but with the failing of the forests, their range was diminished, so that by the time of the War of the Ring, they were only found in any numbers in the Forest of Fangorn.  Though they had remained hidden in the Forest for centuries at this time, they emerged to play an important part in that War, overcoming Saruman's fortress at Isengard, and helping to destroy his troops.

	A harbour of the Elves of Lindon
	A harbour that lay on the northern shore of the Gulf of Lh&#251;n, in the Elvish land of Forlindon.  Its precise location is open to question.  In Appendix A to The Lord of the Rings, there's an account of the arrival of the Gondorian general E&#228;rnur in Lindon, where we're told that his ships filled the Forlond.  That account strongly suggests that the harbour represented no more than the northern part of Mithlond, the Grey Havens.  According to the maps that accompany The Lord of the Rings, though, the Forlond was placed some two hundred miles to the west of the Havens, at the mouth of the Gulf of Lh&#251;n.
	Whichever of these alternatives is correct, we can be sure that it lay on the northern shore of the Gulf, because the name Forlond is derived from the Elvish for 'north haven'.  It had an equivalent on the southern shore, too: the Harlond or 'south haven'.

In the far north was a region around the peak of Sorontil, where the landscape fell sheer into the sea forming tremendous cliffs.  This was the abode of Eagles, and also the dwelling-place of Meneldur Elentirmo, heir to N&#250;menor's throne and a watcher of the stars, who built a great tower here to follow the movements of the heavens.
	Notes
	1
	'Northlands' is the standard translation given by Tolkien.  Though the for- element is very well established as 'north', ostar doesn't seem to literally mean 'lands'.  It's possibly related to the stem os-, meaning 'round' or 'about', so that the Forostar would be one of five regions (along with the Andustar, the Orrostar and so on) surrounding the central highlands of the Mittalmar.  Alternatively, ostar might refer to enclosures or homesteads within the region, making Forostar literally 'enclosed lands of the north', or the word might have some other meaning, yet to be discovered.

Fourth Age
	[fourthage.txt]
	The centuries after the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Began on 29 September IV 1Officially held to have begun on 25 March of the same year in Gondor
	The last of the four ages chronicled by Tolkien, and the one about which least is known (including its length).  The Fourth Age was held to have begun with the passing of the Ring-bearers over the sea from Mithlond on 29 September 3021 (Third Age), though in Gondor it was reckoned as beginning on 25 March of the same year (the second anniversary of the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r).41Buckland and the Westmarch are officially incorporated into the Shire.63Death of King &#201;omer of Rohan; he is succeeded by his son Elfwine.120Death of King Aragorn II Elessar of Gondor; he is succeeded by his son Eldarion.172A copy of the Red Book of Westmarch is completed in Gondor by Findegil, the King's Writer.  This is the last event chronicled by Tolkien.For a full chronicle of events from theFourth Age, see the Chronicle of Arda
	Although we have no records of the later Fourth, or any following Age, Tolkien makes a brief allusion to the future of Middle-earth in a letter written in 1958: &quot;I imagine the gap [between the Fall of Barad-d&#251;r and modern times] to be about 6000 years; that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages were of about the same length as S[econd] A[ge] and T[hird] A[ge].  But they have, I think, quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh.&quot;This note is especially interesting, as it gives some ground for bringing Tolkien's dating system up to date.  The fact that we are 'at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh' hints strongly that Tolkien saw some important historical event as marking the recent (or imminent) end of the Sixth Age.  Each of the three Ages we know about ended with a great war and the fall of a tyrant, and Tolkien was writing just thirteen years after the end of the Second World War: could there be a connection?While this is circumstantial at best, it does seem to hint that perhaps the Downfall of the Third Reich was to the Sixth Age what the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r was to the Third. If so, we can 'reset' the calendar in 1945, which would be the first year of the Seventh Age.  The letter quoted above, then, would have been written in VII 14, which explains Tolkien's reference to the change of Age, while the year 2000 would be VII 56.It's important to stress that there's absolutely no direct evidence for any of this - it's just harmless speculation.  We do know, though, that Tolkien was fastidious in calculating his dating systems: it's unlikely that he would have mentioned a change of Age if he didn't have solid reasons for doing so.

	Race:

	Family:
	House of Eorl
	Pronunciation:

	Meaning:
	Probably 'friend (or companion) of Fr&#233;a'1
	Titles:
	King of the Mark, King of Rohan, Lord of the Mark
	Fr&#233;aFR&#201;AWINEGoldwine
	The son of Fr&#233;a and grandson of Aldor the Old.  On account of his grandfather's immensely long reign, Fr&#233;awine, like his father before him, became Rohan's King in his old age, when he was already more than sixty years old.  Little is said of his twenty-one years as King, except that it was a time of peace and plenty in the Mark.  Fr&#233;awine was succeeded by his son Goldwine.
	Notes
	1
	fr&#233;a literally means 'lord' or 'king', but the reference in Fr&#233;awine's name is more likely to his father, whose name happened to be 'Fr&#233;a'.  The notion of Fr&#233;awine being his father's 'friend' or 'companion' may not be accidental - Fr&#233;a's father Aldor enjoyed an incredibly long reign.  This meant that, for the period between Fr&#233;awine's birth in III 2594 and Aldor's death in III 2645, Fr&#233;a and Fr&#233;awine were heirs-in-waiting together for a total of fifty-one years.Even more remarkably, Fr&#233;awine's own son Goldwine, and Goldwine's son D&#233;or, were all born within Aldor's reign.  At one point, between III 2644 and III 2645, five generations of the royal house of Rohan were extant at the same time.  When old Aldor died, his young great-great-grandson D&#233;or was about one year old.

	A lord of far western Rohan, who was descended from King Fr&#233;awine.  His lands stood on either side of the River Adorn, which marked Rohan's western border, and it was said that he had Dunlendish blood in his veins, too, from the people of Dunland beyond the border.  Nonetheless he was a lord of Rohan and a councillor to its King, Helm.
	Freca attempted to strengthen his power in Rohan by marrying his son, Wulf, to Helm's daughter.  He travelled to Edoras with a force of Men to compel the King to agree, but instead Helm struck him a deadly blow with his fist.  Freca's family and followers fled from Helm's anger, but four years later Wulf returned, invading Rohan with an army of Dunlendings, an invasion in which Helm was killed.  Nevertheless, the slaying of Freca was not forgotten by his people, and even at the time of the War of the Ring, more than two hundred and fifty years later, the memory of his death still kindled hatred of the Rohirrim among the Dunlendings.

	Heir of Bilbo Baggins, and hero of the Lord of the Rings.  Renowned for bearing the One Ring to the land of Mordor, and bringing it to the Cracks of Doom.Life in the Shire, III 2968 - III 3018Frodo's father, Drogo, had left Hobbiton and removed to Buckland to live with his wife's family, and so Frodo was raised in Brandy Hall, the ancestral home of the Brandybucks.  He lost both his parents in a boating accident in 2980. He was close to his distant cousin Bilbo, and nine years after the loss of his parents, Bilbo officially adopted him as his heir.  At this time, Frodo moved back from Buckland to Hobbiton.Although Bilbo often referred to Frodo as his 'favourite nephew', he was in fact his first cousin once removed (through his mother), and also his second cousin once removed (through his father).Frodo lived with Bilbo at Bag End for twelve years, and inherited some of his peculiarities. It was said that he would meet with Elves in the woods, for example, and Bilbo allowed him to read his diary of the journey to Erebor.In 3001, Bilbo held the great Birthday Party on 22 September (a birthday Frodo happened to share) and afterwards departed from the Shire, leaving Frodo to come into his inheritance, including (after much persuasion by Gandalf) the Ring.After Bilbo's departure, Gandalf visited Hobbiton only occasionally.  Frodo often went walking in the Shire, sometimes with his friends Folco Boffin, Fredegar Bolger, Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, but more often alone.  His gardener at Bag End was Samwise Gamgee, who was to accompany him on his great journey.On 12 April 3018, Gandalf returned, having discovered the truth about the Ring, and so Frodo discovered the history behind the One Ring, and the great danger it held.  He resolved to leave the Shire with it.To cover his departure, Frodo sold Bag End to Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, and bought a small house at Crickhollow in Buckland, the region where he had been brought up.  He departed from Hobbiton with Peregrin Took and Sam Gamgee on 23 September 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday.
	Notes
	1
	The derivation of Frodo's name is explained in Tolkien's Letters (No 168, dated 1955), where he also explains that '...it had mythological connexions with the legends of the Golden Age in the North.'  This seems to be a reference to the King Fr&#243;&#240;i of the Danes, whose reign was legendary for its prosperity and fruitfulness.

Immediately to the north of the village, the stream known as the Water broke into two, creating a wide watery region - this feature seems to have given Frogmorton its name, which means 'frog marsh'. Until the War of the Ring, the village seems to have been most notable for its inn, The Floating Log. During the brief time when Saruman took over the Shire, though, it became the home of the First Eastfarthing Troop of Shirriffs, and it was here that the returning Ring-bearers were 'arrested' on their journey back to Hobbiton.

	A common nickname for the father of Samwise Gamgee, who was more properly called 'Hamfast'.  He presumably acquired the name 'Gaffer' later in his life, because it implies a person of advanced years.  This was certainly true of Hamfast, who was old enough to remember Bilbo's return from Erebor, and was no less than ninety-two years old when his son Sam left the Shire with Frodo.'Gaffer' has another meaning, too, which is no doubt also relevant.  In British slang, a 'gaffer' is a foreman, a person who supervises a job.  At the time of Bilbo's Birthday Party, we're told that Hamfast, who was then seventy-five, oversaw the gardening at Bag End, but was helped by his son Sam.  In that sense, then, Gaffer Gamgee actually was a 'gaffer'.

	A name occasionally, and incorrectly, used of Galadriel after she became Lady of L&#243;rien, and meaning 'tree-garland'.  As the Lady of the Galadhrim, whose capital was at Caras Galadhon, it is perhaps understandable that her name should have become confused with the Elvish word galadh, meaning 'tree'.  Nonetheless, this usage was mistaken - her true name 'Galadriel' actually derived from the word galad, 'radiant', and the false variant 'Galadhriel' was never used in her own country of L&#243;rien itself.
	Notes
	1
	We know that this name came into use after Galadriel took up the rule of L&#243;rien with her husband Celeborn; it is related to the name Galadhrim, referring to the people of that land.  The precise date of her arrival in L&#243;rien isn't known, but the available evidence points to a date close to III 2000.

	Lord of Dor-l&#243;min and father to H&#250;rin and Huor.
	Notes
	1
	Galdor's date of birth is nowhere recorded, but there are some clues available to us.  We know from The Silmarillion that his father Hador was sixty-six years old in I 455 (the date of his death in the Dagor Bragollach).  We also know from the Narn i H&#238;n H&#250;rin in Unfinished Tales that Galdor's son H&#250;rin was 'new-come to manhood' when Galdor himself fell seven years later.  These facts favour a date of birth somewhere between I 410 and I 420.
	2
	According to Christopher Tolkien in The Etymologies (in The History of Middle-earth volume 5), there are two possible Elvish roots that might account for Galdor's name: gala-, meaning to thrive or prosper, or the better known galad-, 'tree'.  The '-dor' element of his name seems to mean 'lord'.  Galdor's name, then, probably means either 'prosperous lord' or 'tree lord'.  Given that his father's House was at the height of its power when he was named, and the country Hador ruled was more or less tree-less, the former seems rather more likely.
	3
	Family Tree IV in The Silmarillion shows Gundor to the left of Galdor, suggesting that he was the elder brother.  In fact, this seems to be merely for convenience of layout, since the text states clearly that Gundor was the younger brother (in chapter 18, Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin).

	In origin a Maia of Manw&#235; and Varda, Gandalf came to the northwest of Middle-earth after a thousand years of the Third Age had passed, with four others of his order.  At the Grey Havens, C&#237;rdan entrusted him with the Red Ring, Narya, to aid him in contesting the will of Sauron.Gandalf wandered widely in Middle-earth, and learned much of its races and peoples.  Unlike his fellow Wizards Saruman and Radagast, he never settled in a single place.  He was instrumental in the victory of the War of the Ring, but during that conflict he battled with a Balrog, and though he was ultimately victorious, his spirit left his body, but was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his task.Gandalf finally left Middle-earth in  3021 (Third Age), when he departed over the sea with the Ring-bearers.Arrival in Middle-earth, c. III 1000The Wizards arrived in Middle-earth after the end of the first millennium of the Third Age. They were sent by the Valar to aid Elves and Men, but none knew this but C&#237;rdan the Shipwright, Lord of the Grey Havens where their ships put in.  Though Saruman was at that time the acknowledged leader of the Wizards, C&#237;rdan saw that Gandalf was in fact the greater, and secretly gave him the Red Ring Narya to aid him in his quest.Exploration of Middle-earth, c. III 1000 to III 2463For almost 1,500 years, Gandalf wandered the northern and western regions of Middle-earth, learning of its lands and cultures.  He was closest in friendship with the Elves, and especially Elrond, who had learned of his origins from C&#237;rdan.The White Council, III 2463 to III 2953At almost the same time as Gandalf had arrived in Middle-earth, a dark power had appeared in southern Mirkwood, at the evil place known as Dol Guldur.  After a thousand years of his wanderings, Gandalf went there and drove the darkness into the east for a while.  Soon it returned, and in 2463 (Third Age), the greatest among Wizards and Elves formed a White Council, with Gandalf as a prominent member, to counter the growing threat.In 2850, he revisited Dol Guldur, to find that the power that held it had grown indeed during the eight hundred years since his last visit.  He recognised the dark power now as Sauron returned, and escaped to inform the White Council. Before he escaped, though, he found Thr&#225;in II broken in the pits of Dol Guldur, and though Thr&#225;in died before Gandalf could help him, he did surrender a map and a key into the Wizard's keeping.The Year III 29412941 was an important year for Gandalf. Not only did he take part in the White Council's expulsion of the Necromancer from Dol Guldur, but he also arranged for a party of Dwarves, accompanied by Bilbo Baggins, to travel to their ancient home of Erebor and free it from the dragon Smaug.Gandalf and the HobbitsThe Hobbits first appeared in the records of Men and Elves shortly after the arrival of the Wizards, but of all the Wise, Gandalf was the only one to pay them great heed.  After the foundation of the Shire, he would visit periodically and was responsible for '...quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures' (The Hobbit, Chapter 1, An Unexpected Party). Given this description, we are forced to wonder whether he had a hand in the exploits of Hildifons and Isengar Took, both of whom are recorded as having become involved in adventures of this kind.Of all the hobbit families, Gandalf seems to have been most closely associated with the Tooks; he was a close friend of Gerontius, the Old Took (Frodo Baggins' great-grandfather), and was said to have given him a gift of magical diamond studs, which fastened and unfastened on command.  After Gerontius' death in 2920 (Third Age), he was not seen in the Shire for more than twenty years, until he returned with Thorin and the Dwarves to involve Bilbo Baggins in the Quest of Erebor. Gandalf&#146;s AppearanceLike all the Wizards, Gandalf had the appearance of an old man, who grew old slowly with the passage of the centuries.  His hair was white, and his long white beard grew down below his waist.  His eyebrows were particularly noticeable; they were so long and bushy that they stuck out from beneath the rim of his hat.He dressed in a long grey cloak, which is perhaps the origin of his title 'The Grey'.  He is also described as wearing a tall shady-brimmed pointed blue hat, a silver scarf, and long black boots.  He carried at all times a spiked staff.The Magic of GandalfTolkien at no point defines what the limits of Gandalf's magic were.  As a Maia, he had many natural abilities that would seem magical to mortal races, but he also had a great store of knowledge of more 'mechanical' magic, worked through spells and incantations, and especially through the agency of his staff.  It is clear that he had far greater power, especially after his return as Gandalf the White, than he ever displayed in Middle-earth.His magical powers seem to be particularly associated with fire, a fact that is perhaps related to the Ring of Fire, Narya, that he bore.&#149;The ability to produce light from his staff.  He did this not only when guiding the Company of the Ring through Moria, but also in Bilbo Baggin's hobbit-hole in The Hobbit.-->A Gandalf Miscellany&#149;Gandalf adopted the habit of pipe-smoking from the Hobbits.  He often used his magical arts while smoking; he could change the colour of his smoke-rings, or send them in any direction he pleased.&#149;Gandalf's preferred drink was red wine.

	A gateway in the mountains between northern Nevrast and Hithlum, built by the Noldor who followed Turgon in the earliest years of the First Age.  After Turgon's departure to Gondolin, the Gate was lost, but it was rediscovered and used centuries later by Tuor in his escape from the oppressed lands of Hithlum.
	Notes
	1
	Turgon and his people abandoned Nevrast for Gondolin in about the year I 126, so the Gate cannot have been built after that date.  Turgon's craftsmen, though, had been working on the Hidden City for about seventy years before this, and it seems unlikely that they would have left that work to build the Gate.  Most likely, then, is a construction date some time before this, in the first fifty years of the First Age.

Giants

	Huge Man-like monsters
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Known to be extant in III 29411
	Origins:
	Not known2
	Divisions:
	Stone-giants
	Perhaps the most mysterious of the races of Middle-earth, Giants are mentioned only fleetingly by Tolkien, but sufficiently often to show that they did exist in his world.
	Notes
	1
	The only definite sighting of giants occurred during Bilbo's journey through the Misty Mountains, in the year III 2941.  That they had a history preceding this is certain, because we have a reference to ancient bears living in the Misty Mountains '...before the giants came.' (The Hobbit 7 'Queer Lodgings').  What became of the giants is entirely unknown: apart from a few very vague references in The Lord of the Rings, they are never mentioned again.
	2
	Where the giants came from is a mystery.  They don't seem to fit at all easily into Tolkien's universe, but there are some possible explanations.The first of these is the simplest - that they didn't actually exist.  As Bilbo and his friends travelled through the Mountains, they encountered a thunderstorm, and Tolkien says, '...across the valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling rocks at one another for a game...' (The Hobbit 4 'Over Hill and Under Hill').  This could just be a metaphor for the crashing of the thunder and lightning, and if so, it's possible that there were no giants at all.  In truth, though, this seems a rather unlikely possibility, and the characters in The Hobbit certainly behave as if the giants are real.  Thorin is even worried about being picked up by them, and much later Gandalf suggests finding a friendly giant to deal with the goblins in the Mountains.If we presume that the giants were real - and they do seem to have been - the next possibility to consider is that they might have belonged in some way to the race of Men.  This isn't as far-fetched as it might seem.  We do know, for instance, that both Hobbits and Dr&#251;gs were distantly related to Men.  If a very small type of Man - the Hobbit - could develop, why not an especially large type as well?  There is some slight support for this possibility among the drafts of The Lord of the Rings, where we're told that '...giants were spoken of, a Big Folk only far bigger and stronger than Men the [?ordinary] Big Folk...' (The History of Middle-earth volume VI, The Return of the Shadow XV 'Ancient History').If it's possible that giants were a type of Men, it's at least equally possible that they were actually Ents.  After all, in its ultimate origins Ent is just an Anglo-Saxon word for 'giant', and in his original conception, Tolkien referred, for example, to 'the Giant Treebeard'.  What's more, in Pippin's description of the destruction of Isengard, we hear that the Ents were '...hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves.' The Two Towers III 9  'Flotsam and Jetsam').  This is more than a little reminiscent of Bilbo's encounter in the Misty Mountains.It's important to remember that, at the time he was writing The Hobbit, Tolkien was engaged in writing a simple children's story.  It's unlikely that he gave much thought to fitting the giants into a larger scheme.  Indeed, at that point, the Ents did not even exist in his imagination, so any later explanation - if indeed he devised one at all - must have been fitted to the facts after the event.

	Words of Eru Il&#250;vatarFrom Quenta Silmarillion 1, Of the Beginning of Days
	Death; the gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children, allowing them to go beyond the confines of the World.  After death, Mortal Men were gathered in the Halls of Mandos, and then departed from the World for a destination unknown even to the Valar.  Whereas all other beings in Arda, including the Valar themselves, were bound to the World and its fate, the Gift freed Men from this destiny, allowing them to shape their own lives as they wished.
	Those Men with the greatest understanding treated death as the Gift it was originally intended to be, and when their time came gladly gave themselves up to it.  We see this, for example, in the earlier Kings of N&#250;menor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the natural end of his life.  For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by Morgoth, and they came to fear it rather than embrace it.  This fear reached its peak in the later years of N&#250;menor, where even the long life given to the N&#250;men&#243;reans was not enough, and wise men did all they could to try to escape death altogether.  In the end, this desperation led to N&#250;menor's destruction when Ar-Pharaz&#246;n led a battle fleet to the Undying Lands, falsely believing that they held the secret of everlasting life.

	Sixth and last of the High Kings of the Noldor.  The only son of High King Fingon, Gil-galad was born late in the First Age, and was still a child at the time of the Dagor Bragollach; his father sent him to C&#237;rdan at the Havens for safekeeping when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in that battle.Fingon was lost in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the crown passed to Gil-galad's uncle Turgon in Gondolin, rather than Gil-galad himself (presumably because of his youth at that time).  When Gondolin was lost, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Noldor; he dwelt with the Exiles of the city at the Mouths of Sirion during the remainder of the First Age.After the destruction of Beleriand during the War of Wrath, Gil-galad founded a kingdom in Lindon in the far northwest of Middle-earth, between the Blue Mountains and the Great Sea. There he and his people prospered, until Sauron returned; he came first to Lindon in the form of Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, but Gil-galad and Elrond rejected him.  Soon after, the One Ring was forged, and there was war in Middle-earth between the Elves and Sauron.After the Downfall of N&#250;menor, Elendil and his sons came to Middle-earth and formed an alliance with Gil-galad, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.  They marched on Mordor and besieged Sauron's Dark Tower.  Sauron was defeated, but Gil-galad met his death in that war.

	Notes
	1
	In the Appendix to The Silmarillion, in his discussion of the root word ran- 'wander, stray', Christopher Tolkien writes that this root is '...also in the river Gilraen in Gondor.'  This seems to be a slight error: the name of the river is the Gilrain rather than the Gilraen (though this may merely be a matter of transliteration from Elvish).  It isn't clear, therefore, whether the interpretation 'star-wanderer', which is definitely correct for Gilrain the river, can also be applied to Gilraen the person.

River Gilrain
	[gilrain.txt]
	The western border-river of Lebennin
	Location:
	Western Lebennin, in the south of Gondor
	Source:
	In the White Mountains, some forty miles south of Min-Rimmon

	Outflow:

	Pronunciation:

	Meaning:
	'star-wanderer'1
	A long river that flowed south out of the White Mountains through western Lebennin in the south of Gondor.  It was a tributary of the River Serni, that it joined above Linhir, and legend said that Nimrodel had walked its banks as she came south out of the White Mountains.
	Notes
	1
	This derivation is connected to the legend of Nimrodel.  Though the Gilrain was for most of its length a fast, straight river, there was a region about half-way between its source and its mouth where it wandered somewhat, and formed a small mere before flowing on. According to the story,  Nimrodel herself wandered beside the river as she descended from the White Mountains, and saw the reflected stars glinting in the mere's waters.  She sat beside the pool and slept, and so she did not reach Amroth's ship before it sailed.

He fought at the Battle of the Hornburg, and at the Pelennor Fields. He is famed for his fast friendship with Legolas the Elf; some stories say that they sailed into the West together - if this is true, then Gimli was the first and only of dwarven-kind to come to the Undying Lands.
	Notes
	1
	In common with nearly all Tolkien's dwarf-names, Gimli comes from a Mannish tongue, based on Old Norse.  Unusually, Tolkien himself seems uncertain on the original meaning of Gimli. In his Letters, he writes 'its meaning seems to have been "fire"' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 297, dated 1967).In Norse mythology, Gimli was not the name of a person, but of a place: a great golden-roofed hall in Asgard where the righteous were taken after death. A golden-roofed hall appears in Tolkien's work, too, of course - the Golden Hall of Meduseld at Edoras - though it is unclear whether there is a connection.In Ad&#251;naic, gimli means 'stars' (gimil, 'star', appears in names such as Gimilkh&#226;d) but this is probably no more than a coincidence.

	From an old Mannish word, gl&#230;dene, referring to a kind of yellow flower1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	S&#238;r Ninglor
	A minor tributary of the River Anduin, called S&#238;r Ninglor by the Elves, that rose in the eastern Misty Mountains and flowed eastward to meet the Great River at the Gladden Fields.Though it was hardly more than a hundred miles long, the Gladden played a great part in the histories of the Third Age of the World.  In the middle years of that Age war raged in Eriador to the west of the Misty Mountains.  In about the year III 1409 a clan of refugee Hobbits, of the strong and resilient Stoor variety, fled eastward across the Mountains and settled by the banks of the Gladden.We know little of these people, but their society was apparently matriarchal, and they shared many of the same ancient habits and superstitions as their more familiar cousins who remained west of the Mountains.  We know that they made a living by fishing among the golden flowers of the Gladden River, and so founded a successful settlement that would last for at least another thousand years.Some centuries later, another great war occurred, but this time far to the south and east, beyond the forest of Mirkwood.  The Stoors knew nothing of this, until refugees from the battles of the south came to settle on the plains to the north of the Gladden.  These were noble, fair-haired Men, descendants of the Kings of Rhovanion and ancestors of the Kings of Rohan.  They called themselves simply 'horse-people', or &#201;oth&#233;od in their own tongue.  These people did not remain by the Gladden for long.  Within two centuries, they rode further north to seek new, more open, lands.Though the &#201;oth&#233;od rode into the distant north, many Men remained and so did the Stoors.  More than a millennium after their arrival, in about the twenty-fifth century of the Third Age, two young friends of that people journeyed east on the river together to the mouths of the Gladden, where it emptied into the marshlands of the Fields.  Through a strange accident, one of them, D&#233;agol by name, fell into the water, and discovered a golden Ring sparkling in the mud on the bottom2.  His friend, Sm&#233;agol, wanted the Ring for himself: he throttled D&#233;agol, and stole back to his people with the golden and magical Ring.  Eventually, his grandmother, who ruled his family, cast him out and he left the banks of the Gladden River to wander into the Misty Mountains and into history, and his name became Gollum.While Gollum skulked away the centuries under the Mountains of Mist, he outlived all his family and his people.  Soon after Gollum's exile, Orcs began to mass in the Mountains nearby, and War of the Dwarves and Orcs brought the armies of the Dwarves to these regions too. Perhaps the Stoors were destroyed by the Orcs, or overrun in the War.  Perhaps they were lost in the Fell Winter of III 2911.  Whatever happened, we know that no Stoors were left there at the time of the War of the Ring: the Nazg&#251;l went there in search of the Ring, and found only ruins.But Gollum's wretched life was stretched out by his magic Ring beyond that of all his kind, until at last that Ring was taken from him.  He hunted for it all down the Vales of Anduin, and was himself hunted by Aragorn, at Gandalf's request.  Aragorn captured him near the borders of Mordor at the beginning of the year III 3018, and toiled northward with his prisoner.  We have an account of his travels in the Unfinished Tales.'...by tracks as westerly as he could find, through the skirts of Fangorn, and so over Limlight, then over Nimrodel and Silverlode through the eaves of L&#243;rien, and then on, avoiding Moria and the Dimrill Dale, over Gladden...'The Hunt for the Ring (ii)in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth(our italics)So the last survivor of the Gladden Stoors saw the long-deserted lands of his home once more before the end.
	Notes
	1
	Gl&#230;dene is in fact Old English, but is represented by Tolkien as belonging to the language of the Rohirrim, whose ancient ancestors lived in this region.  He associates it especially with a species of iris known as 'yellow flag' (properly known, he explains in his Letters, as Iris pseudacorum).  These yellow flowers grew along the river and among the marshes of the Gladden Fields, hence the name.  The Elvish word ninglor as indirectly related: it means 'goldwater', which presumably refers to the flowers' golden reflections in the riverwater.

	This Ring had lain in the mud of the Gladden Fields for more than two thousand years. For the full story of how it came to be there, see the entry for Disaster of the Gladden Fields.

Glamdring
	[glamdring.txt]
	The sword of Turgon and Gandalf
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Forged in the First Age some time between c.I 126 and I 510Rediscovered by Gandalf in May or June III 2941Probably passed into the West 29 September III 3021
	Origins:
	Forged in Gondolin for Turgon
	Meaning:
	Given as 'Foe-hammer'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Beater, Foe-hammer
	&quot;This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore.&quot;
	Words of Elrondfrom The Hobbit 3 A Short Rest
	Of Glamdring's early history, we know almost nothing.  From Elrond's words, we can say that it was forged some time in the second to fifth centuries of the First Age (the centuries when Gondolin existed), and that it was borne by Turgon (the only Elf to hold the title 'King of Gondolin').  After Gondolin was built, Turgon was in battle twice: at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and at the Fall of Gondolin.  Glamdring was greatly feared by the Orcs even thousands of years later, so Turgon must have wielded it ferociously on both these occasions.After Gondolin's Fall, Glamdring passed out of history or rumour for more than 6,000 years. The fact that it survived the War of Wrath, though, tells us that it must have left Beleriand before the end of the First Age, perhaps carried eastward by a band of Orcs2. More than that cannot be said, except that somehow, by the late Third Age, it had fallen into the hands of the three trolls called in The Hobbit Tom, Bert and Bill Huggins.It was discovered in their troll-hoard by Gandalf, Bilbo and the Dwarves as they travelled eastward on the Quest of Erebor, and claimed by Gandalf.  After it was identified by Elrond, Gandalf wore it for eighty years.  He had it with him when the White Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur, and he bore it through the War of the Ring itself.Famously, he used it to battle the Balrog at the Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m, and it fell with him there into the abyss.  Glamdring survived that fall3: Gandalf had it with him when he returned, and he bore it throughout the last days of the War of the Ring and beyond.  We know that he still had the sword when he rode through Bree with the Travellers in October III 3019, but Tolkien doesn't mention it after that point.  It seems safe to assume, though, that Gandalf was still wearing Glamdring, as he had for eighty years, when he boarded the White Ship at the end of the Third Age.
	What Did Glamdring Look Like?We know much less about Glamdring's appearance than its history.  It is consistently described as 'white' (in The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m). When enemies were near it 'shone with a pale light' (ibid).  In the same circumstances, the Elven-knife Sting glittered along its edges, but in Glamdring's case, the entire blade seems to have glowed.  Finally, we know from The Hobbit that both Glamdring and its mate Orcrist had runed blades, giving at least their names.
	Notes
	1
	Actually, the literal translation of glam is 'noise', not 'foe'.  'Foe-hammer' comes from glamhoth dring, 'noise-host hammer' - glamhoth is an Elvish term for Orcs.
	2
	This is only one possible way that Glamdring might have left Beleriand.  It assumes that the sword was looted from the wreck of Gondolin, but it isn't easy to explain why it should have been carried into the east.  Alternatively, it might have been rescued from the Fall of Gondolin by (say) Tuor, and taken eastward by the Elves.  In this case, though, we would need to explain how it was lost a second time, and how Elrond (who was with the Exiles of Gondolin at the end of the First Age) had apparently forgotten about it.
	3
	If it is difficult to explain how Glamdring escaped destruction in the War of Wrath, its escape from the depths of Khazad-d&#251;m is doubly puzzling.  What details we have come from Gandalf's account in The Two Towers III V The White Rider.  This makes it clear that Gandalf had somehow managed to hold onto Glamdring as he fell.  As he fights the Balrog in the depths, he says that 'ever I hewed him', which means he must have had the sword with him.Glamdring isn't mentioned again until long afterwards.  Gandalf must have kept it as he climbed the Endless Stair, and perhaps used it in the Battle of the Peak to finally destroy Durin's Bane. What isn't clear, though is how it survived Gandalf's destruction and re-embodiment - he says explicitly 'naked I was sent back'.  We have to imagine that it survived the ruin of Celebdil's peak, and was perhaps later recovered by Gwaihir.

He first issued from Angband in 265 (First Age), but not being fully grown at that time, the Noldor under Fingon were able to drive him back.In the Dagor Bragollach and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung was in the vanguard of Morgoth's forces, and having grown to his full power, he wreaked great destruction on those battlefields. In the Nirnaeth, he was driven back to Angband by the heavily armoured Dwarves, though their lord Azagh&#226;l was slain in that battle.Glaurung led the assault by Morgoth on Nargothrond, and there came across T&#250;rin for the first time.  He dwelt in the ruined halls of Finrod Felagund for a while, but came forth at last to seek T&#250;rin.  He was slain by T&#250;rin's black sword Gurthang in the Forest of Brethil.

	The Problem of the Two GlorfindelsWith the possible exception of Tom Bombadil's identity (and - of course - the wingedness or otherwise of Balrogs), there is no more hotly debated topic than the ultimate fate of Glorfindel.  Were Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell the same person?The only real resource we have to answer this question is in The Peoples of Middle-earth (The History of Middle-earth Vol. 12): XIII Last Writings, Glorfindel. Christopher Tolkien dates the notes he gives here at 1972, the year before his father's death.These notes clear up one question immediately: at the time of the writing of The Lord of the Rings, Glorfindel of Rivendell was not conceived as the same character as Glorfindel of Gondolin.  Tolkien says, 'Its use [i.e. the name 'Glorfindel'] in The Lord of the Rings is one of the cases of the somewhat random use of the names found in the older legends ... which escaped reconsideration in the final published form...'.Tolkien was far from happy with this state of affairs, however, and it seems that he intended to reconcile the problem by uniting the two strands of the story.  In summary, the notes tell us that Glorfindel's spirit returned to the Halls of Waiting, but was after a time re-embodied by the Valar.  He then returned to Middle-earth (either in the mid-Second Age, or as a companion of the Istari in the Third).  For the full story of his return, refer to The Peoples of Middle-earth.The question of Glorfindel's identity, then, brings us to a much wider, and highly relevant, question.  Can we accept a writer's personal notes, whether written in preparation for a published work, or simply for personal satisfaction, as part of that writer's 'canon'?The importance of this question is highlighted by the essay entitled The Problem of Ros in the same volume of The History of Middle-earth.  This is an extensive disposition on the origins and meaning of the syllable ros in names such as Elros. The details need not concern us here: what is relevant is the fact that, after its composition, Tolkien noticed a detail in the published Lord of the Rings that essentially negated the discussion.  He dismissed the body of The Problem of Ros with four words; 'most of this fails'.But what if he had not noticed this inconvenient fact (that Cair Andros had already been interpreted, and disagreed with his conclusions)?  What if he had noticed, but had failed to record the fact?  Would The Problem of Ros now be considered part of the 'Tolkienian' canon in the way that many regard the notes on Glorfindel?  Questions like this show that we cannot simply take such notes on immediate face value.Despite this, the Glorfindel notes lead many to see his re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth as 'fact' (and not a few have e-mailed us to remind us of this!)  The purpose of this rather lengthy aside, though, is to show that we cannot view these 'events' in such concrete terms.  This is the reason that the 'two Glorfindels' have separate entries on this site. This is not because we do not believe that Tolkien saw them as different embodiments of the same character (as we have seen, there are strong indications that he did), but simply because there is no definitive, published, proof of this.
	Notes
	1
	The Noldor were normally dark-haired, but the golden hair of the Vanyar was introduced through Indis, a Vanyarin Elf-maiden; hence the descendants of her sons Fingolfin and Finarfin sometimes had golden hair, suggesting that Glorfindel may have come from this noble line.

	The question of Glorfindel's identity remains an open one.  There are arguments to be made that Glorfindel of Rivendell was the same Glorfindel that was slain in the Fall of Gondolin, returned to Middle-earth from the Halls of Waiting. For a discussion of this point, see the entry for Glorfindel of Gondolin.

	Creatures created by Saruman, apparently by blending the races of Orcs and Men.  Precisely what they were is mysterious - they are only ever mentioned once by name, during the Battle of the Hornburg - but the limited evidence available seems suggest that they were distinct from half-orcs.
	Notes
	1
	Goblin-men are only ever identified by name on one occasion - at the Battle of the Hornburg on the night of 3 March III 3019.  Even then, the term is only ever used by Gamling of Rohan, who would hardly be expected to have a detailed knowledge of Saruman's breeding programmes.  For that reason, we cannot be certain that 'goblin-men' existed as a separate type of creature: they may have been no more than a variation of the half-orcs, or something else beyond Gamling's knowledge.

	Is there a difference between an 'Orc' and a 'Goblin'?  The following quote from the foreword to The Hobbit sheds some light on this: &quot;[The word 'Orc'] occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds).&quot;(Hence the statement above; 'especially the smaller kinds').  This entry concentrates on the goblins of the Grey and Misty Mountains simply because it is these Orcs that Tolkien most frequently refers to by the term 'goblin'.The word 'goblin' is also used occasionally and indiscriminately in The Lord of the Rings; it never occurs in the The Silmarillion.
	Notes
	1
	The relationship of 'goblin' to 'kobold' is a theory proposed by the Oxford English Dictionary, which suggests the following derivation (we've taken the liberty of expanding their standard abbreviations):'Middle English, probably from Anglo-French *gobelin, medieval Latin gobelinus, probably from name diminutive of Gobel, related to Kobold'The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current EnglishIn fact, there are at least two other theories.  The first concerns two medieval parties, the Guelphs and the Ghibellines.  The Guelphs were supposed to have despised their rival Ghibellines so much that their name became a 'bogey' word, and ultimately evolved into modern 'goblin'.  The Ghibellines despised the Guelphs in equal measure, and so their name, too, apparently descended to modern times as 'elf'. Ingenious and economical as this theory is, it is almost certainly wrong.A somewhat more plausible idea relates goblins back to the almost-forgotten fairy figure of Ghob, the King of the Gnomes.  In Old English, the earth-spirits who followed him might well have been referred to as Ghoblings, and this gives us a third possible source of the name, somewhat older than the other two.

	Valaquenta
	A name wrongly given by Men to the Valar.  While Tolkien states that Men have 'often' called the Valar gods, in fact the term is very rare in his books; it is most prominently used at the debate of Estolad, where the Men newly arrived in Beleriand dispute whether or not to remain.  This is natural, of course; they had not at this point been tutored by the Elves in such high matters.It is tempting to suppose that 'Men have often called them gods' refers to the years after the end of the Third Age, and might even suggest equivalences between the Valar and mythological gods of later times, such as those of the Greeks or Vikings.  This cannot be correct, however; the Valaquenta represents a very ancient text within the context of The Silmarillion, probably dating from the mid to late First Age, and therefore can only refer to the Men of those times.

	Notes
	1
	Frodo and his companions encountered Goldberry in September III 3018. From her description, she appears quite young, but actually she seems to be somewhat older than her appearance suggests.  Tom tells the Hobbits that he met her by the Withywindle 'long ago', but (as so often where Tom is concerned) it isn't entirely clear what he means by this.
	2
	Like Tom himself, Goldberry is a mysterious being whose place in Tolkien's mythology isn't easy to establish.  She seems to be some kind of river-spirit, though some have conjectured that both Tom and Goldberry belong to the order of the Maiar.  For more on these possibilities, consult the entry for Tom Bombadil.In literary terms, Tolkien seems to have intended her character to perform a symbolic role.  In his Letters, he writes 'We are ... in real river-lands in autumn.  Goldberry represents the actual seasonal changes in such lands' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 210, dated 1958).  We can see this symbolism in Frodo's greeting, quoted above, which goes on 'O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!'

Goldwine was the last of Rohan's Kings to enjoy a peaceful reign for many years.

They would trouble the Rohirrim for many generations.
	Notes

	The implications of Goldwine's name aren't entirely certain.  He may have been a 'gold-friend' in the sense that he loved riches, or in the sense that he bought the friendship of his nobles with gold.  Given that Rohan was known to have been both peaceful and prosperous during his reign, the latter might seem the more likely.

Coming under its power, he hid away in the Misty Mountains, and was drawn into the events at the end of the Third Age when he encountered Bilbo Baggins, who took the Ring from him.
	Notes
	1
	Gollum first appears in the Tale of Years in 'about' 2463, when he murders his friend D&#233;agol and steals the Ring.  The birthdate of 2440 given here is an estimate based on the assumption that Sm&#233;agol/Gollum would have been about twenty-five years old at this date.  His long lifespan of almost 600 years is of course far longer than a Hobbit would normally live, and is due to the effects of the Ring.
	2
	Gollum's identification as a Stoor is based on Gandalf's words in The Lord of the Rings I 2 The Shadow of the Past, 'I guess they were of hobbit-kind, akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors'.  Gollum's people split from the other Stoors in the fifteenth century of the Third Age, when troubled times in Eriador led them to migrate back eastwards across the Misty Mountains, and settle on the banks of the Gladden River.

	Gondolin
	The great Hidden City of Turgon was concealed from friend and foe alike during the First Age by the Encircling Mountains, and guarded from trespassers by the Eagles of Thorondor.In the fiftieth year of the First Age, Turgon journeyed from his halls in Nevrast with his cousin Finrod.  Ulmo guided him to the hidden valley of Tumladen, and there he founded Gondolin.  The city was completed in c. I 126, and Turgon's people who had dwelt in Nevrast travelled there secretly.The city was inviolate for almost four hundred years; Turgon did not break his secret leaguer until the time of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in I 471, and even after that disastrous battle he was able to return in secret to the city with the aid of H&#250;rin Thalion.Morgoth's servants finally discovered Gondolin through the treachery of Maeglin, and it was sacked in I 510.  Turgon was lost in the Fall of the city, but some few (including Tuor and Idril, with their child E&#228;rendil) escaped the destruction and dwelt as Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion.The Building of GondolinThe round valley of Tumladen, within the Encircling Mountains, had originally been a lake, and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island: Amon Gwareth.  It was here that Turgon decided to found his Hidden City, as a memorial to ancient Tirion that lay beyond the Great Sea.The first building of the city took fifty-two years to complete.  After this time, the people of Turgon, a great number of Noldor and Sindar, travelled from Nevrast, where they had dwelt, and secretly entered the valley of Tumladen.  Turgon gave his city the name Ondolind&#235; (Quenya for 'The Rock of the Music of Water', because of the fountains of Amon Gwareth), but in Sindarin this was rendered Gondolin, the Hidden Rock.After their arrival in the new city, the Gondolindrim continued to labour in its building, until it was said to rival even Tirion itself.  Its walls stood high and white above the plain, and its most prominent feature was the great Tower of the King, where, among the fountains, Turgon himself made Glingal and Belthil, trees of gold and silver made in memory of the Two Trees of Valinor.The Coming of MaeglinThere followed two centuries of happy peace: Morgoth was besieged in the far north of the world, and the people of Gondolin lived undisturbed by the events outside their fair city.  At last, though, a seed of discontent appeared: King Turgon's sister Aredhel determined to leave the city, much against Turgon's wishes, and journey into Middle-earth.Soon after her departure, her guards returned, and reported that they had lost her in the dark and sorcerous region to the south east of the city, known as Nan Dungortheb.More than twenty years1 then passed, and then suddenly Aredhel returned.  With her was one who she claimed to be Maeglin, her son by E&#246;l the Dark Elf of Nan Elmoth. This Maeglin accepted Turgon as lord, but his father E&#246;l had followed his wife and son to Gondolin and been captured at the entranceway.  He was brought before Turgon.  E&#246;l refused to submit to Turgon's authority, and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son.  He threw a poisoned dart to slay Maeglin, but instead struck Aredhel, who fell ill with the poison and died.  The body of E&#246;l was broken on the Caragd&#251;r for this.Maeglin, though, had had no part in these evils, and Turgon accepted him, and he grew to be among the great in Gondolin, wise in council, cunning in smithcraft and mighty in battle.Two Great BattlesFor more than a hundred years after the deaths of Aredhel and E&#246;l, Gondolin again had peace.  The time was coming, though, when Morgoth would break the Siege of Angband, and the unstoppable doom of the Elves would fall upon them.  One winter's night, the fires of Angband destroyed the leaguer of the Noldor: the Dagor Bragollach.  In this disaster, the people of Gondolin played no immediate part.They were drawn into the events of those years, though, when two young brothers of the race of Men, H&#250;rin and Huor, were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the Crissaegrim. Thorondor brought them to Turgon.  At the bidding of Ulmo, Turgon accepted them, and they remained in Gondolin for almost a year, when they returned to their homes.  In this kindly act were the first seeds of Gondolin's destruction, more than fifty years later.Turgon now devised a new policy for the salvation of the Elves: he began secretly to send his people out westward across the great sea, to seek the land of the Valar and ask their pardon and aid.  None of his mariners succeeded, but this was a wise course, though Turgon never knew it: he was lost long before his grandson E&#225;rendil, aided by a Silmaril, finally succeeded in this task.As time passed since the destruction of the Dagor Bragollach, the Elves of Beleriand began to arm for a counterstroke, and Turgon secretly began his own preparations.  Fourteen years after the breaking of the Siege of Angband, and some three hundred and fifty since the completion of Gondolin, Turgon rode for the first time to war.  Unknown and unbidden by his kin, he rode to their aid with an army of ten thousand.  This was to be the great battle that was to become known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
	Notes
	1
	The published Silmarillion doesn't specify exactly how long Aredhel was away.  The Later Annals of Beleriand (The History of Middle-earth vol V, The Lost Road, III 3) do give a definite figure, though: twenty-one years.  These Annals are in many ways quite incompatible with the extant Silmarillion (for example, Aredhel is there called Isfin, and does not return to Gondolin with Maeglin), but this value seems to fit well with the surviving structure of the story.

	The second of the two great nations of Men founded in Middle-earth by Elendil after the Downfall of N&#250;menor, the other being Arnor in the north.  Gondor was at first ruled jointly by Elendil's sons Isildur and An&#225;rion.  Both Elendil and An&#225;rion were lost in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, and his brother Isildur soon afterwards in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, and so the Kingship of Gondor fell on An&#225;rion's son Meneldil.  Thus, the Kings of Gondor were descendants of An&#225;rion through many generations until the time of E&#228;rnur.When E&#228;rnur was lost in Minas Morgul in III 2050, the rule of Gondor was taken up by the King's Steward, Mardil Voronw&#235;; the death of E&#228;rnur was not certain, and so Mardil and the Stewards who followed him pledged to rule 'until the King comes back'.  Unlikely though this seemed, it happened almost a thousand years later in III 3019 when Aragorn II Elessar, descendant by right line of Isildur, elder brother of An&#225;rion, reclaimed the throne of Gondor.

	Timeline:
	Dates:

	Race:
	Ainur
	Division:
	Maiar (of the kind known as Balrogs)
	Meaning:
	Uncertain.  'Dread Enforcer' is one possibility1
	Titles:
	High-captain of Angband, Lord of Balrogs
	The most powerful of all the Balrogs, one of the chief servants of Melkor, who held an authority hardly less than Sauron himself.  A wily commander and fearsome fighter, Gothmog was often accompanied by others of his fiery kind, and at least in the Nirnaeth he had a personal guard of dozens of trolls.  His weapon was a great black axe.The Elves first encountered him in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the battle fought under the stars before the first rising of the Moon.  In that battle, F&#235;anor's fury had caused him to draw forward of the main force of the Noldor, and so he came upon Gothmog with only a small guard.  Even so, he fought valiantly, and though the armies of the Noldor eventually drove the Balrogs off, F&#235;anor's wounds could not be healed.After that first battle, Gothmog does not appear for several centuries.  He emerged from Angband to fight in the battle known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the fifth and last battle of the Wars of Beleriand.  He brought up a huge army, and drove aside the forces around High King Fingon, and slew the King with his axe.  His trolls assailed Fingon's ally H&#250;rin, who he eventually captured and brought back to Angband.But Gothmog was not indestructible.  He took part in (and indeed presumably led) Morgoth's deadly surprise assault on the Hidden City of Gondolin.  In the square of the King in the heart of the city, he came upon the Elf-lord Ecthelion of the Fountain.  They fought a great duel, and in the end Gothmog and Ecthelion slew one another.  So ended one of the most feared denizens of the pits of Angband.
	Notes

	'Voice of (Mor)goth' and 'Black Master' are two others.  This derivation is difficult, because Tolkien himself seems to have been uncertain of the meaning of the name - all those given here are taken from volume 5 of The History of Middle-earth.

The Darkness described by Treebeard was not dispelled by the coming of the Sun: Morgoth held his fortress of Angband for centuries afterwards, and even after he was overthrown, the Darkness lingered (even at the time of the War of the Ring, remnants of the Great Darkness could still be found in the deep valleys of Fangorn Forest, and elsewhere).

	The Seventh Gate said to have been added to the existing six gates of Gondolin by Maeglin, after Morgoth's victory in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. According to legend, the gate was made of steel and seven storeys high, but inconsistencies between accounts mean that its existence cannot be considered certain.
	Notes
	1
	These dates assume that the Gate was built immediately after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and was destroyed during the sack of Gondolin thirty-nine years later.  These dates are based on circumstantial evidence, and it should be noted that they are speculative in nature.  The Gate may have taken several years to complete, and it may conceivably have survived the Fall of Gondolin.

	Notes

	The Annals of Aman in volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth give us some definite dates for the Journey.  The Vanyar and the Noldor took nearly two centuries to travel from Cuivi&#233;nen to Beleriand, while the Teleri took about thirty years longer. The Journey was completed more than 3,500 years before the beginning of the First Age.  (This was in fact long before the making of the Sun, so the values shown here are converted to solar years from the much longer 'Valian Years' used in the Annals.)

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Forged between c. II 1500 and c. II 1600.  With the destruction of the One Ring in III 3019, the surviving Rings lost their Power.
	Makers:
	The Elves of Eregion, under the instruction of Sauron.Sauron was said to have had no part in the making of the Three Rings, while he alone made the One Ring.
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Rings of Power
	The nineteen powerful Rings forged in Eregion in the Second Age, mostly with the aid of Sauron, of which nine were given by him to Men, and seven to the Dwarves; three the Elves retained.  The One Ring is also counted among the Great, but that was forged by Sauron alone in Orodruin.Although the Elven-smiths of Eregion forged many rings in the mid-Second Age, only these nineteen are considered Great. The nature and abilities of each of the Great Rings differed, but each shared two powers.The first of these was the prolongation or 'stretching' of life - the bearer of a Great Ring did not age.  This effect applied only to mortal bearers of the Rings; the Elves and Wizards were already 'immortal' by nature, and this power did not seem to affect them. This explains the peculiar longevity of Bilbo Baggins and especially Gollum (a creature of hobbit-kind, Gollum should have lived no more than 100 years or so, and yet under the influence of the One Ring, he survived for more than 500 years beneath the Misty Mountains).The second power conferred by the Great Rings was that of invisibility.  At first, this was a temporary effect, and occurred only when the bearer actually wore the ring.  After a time, though, this invisibility would become permanent (hence the nine Ring-wraiths, though their Rings were held by Sauron, were always invisible).  This invisibility seems to have been due to the wearer being transported to the 'wraith-world', a strange 'dimension' that co-exists with the real world.Tolkien's various references to the Great Rings seem to make it clear that they all had the power of invisibility.  However, the Three Rings of the Elves seemed to be exempt from this - although the Rings were normally invisible themselves, their bearers did not vanish (this is perhaps due to Sauron's having no part in their making).The Seven Rings of the Dwarves, which were among the Great Rings, raise a question.  We know that one of these Rings was held by the Kings of Durin's Folk, and yet through all the hundreds of years they bore it, there is no record of this Ring displaying any of its powers.  Though the Dwarf-kings no doubt kept it secret and used it little, there are strong hints here that the Dwarves somehow had a greater immunity to the effects of the Great Rings than other mortal kinds.

It remained an important meeting-place and a centre of gossip long after Bilbo returned from the Quest, and at the time of the famous Birthday Party, Sam Gamgee was among its regular visitors.  For all its proud history, it did not survive the coming of Sharkey and his Men to the Shire during the War of the Ring, and it was a desolate and empty place by the time Sam returned with Frodo and the other Travellers.

Green-elves
	[greenelves.txt]
	The Laiquendi of Ossiriand
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	First seen shortly before the beginning of the First Age; survived at least into the Second Age
	Location:
	Ossiriand, during the First Age
	Origins:
	A branch of the Nandor who crossed the Blue Mountains from the east
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Nandor
	Meaning:
	'Green-elves' is a reference to the camouflaged clothes these Elves wore
	Other&nbsp;names:
	Elves of Ossiriand, Laiquendi
	Lenw&#235; was an Elf of the Telerin clan, who set out with the Great Journey of the Elves into the West.  When his people found their path blocked by the Misty Mountains, he resolved to leave the Journey and instead led his followers south down the Vales of Anduin, and they became known as the Nandor.  After many years, Lenw&#235;'s son Denethor set out westward once again, and led some part of the Nandor across the Misty Mountains and the Blue, settling at last in the Land of Seven Rivers beneath the Ered Luin; the land called Ossiriand.Denethor and his followers did not have peace for long.  Soon after his return to Middle-earth, before the Noldor had followed him, Morgoth loosed armies of orcs on King Thingol and his allies, C&#237;rdan in the west and Denethor in the east.  Denethor's Nandor were ill-equipped for warfare, and suffered great hardship in that battle. Denethor himself was slain on Amon Ereb, though the Elves beat back the orcs at last.  After that time many of Denethor's people left Ossiriand for the guarded forests of Doriath.  Those few that remained took up a secretive existence, camouflaging themselves in green.  From that time, they were known as the Green-elves, or Laiquendi in the Elvish tongue.The hidden people of the Green-elves played little part in history after the First Battle of the Wars of Beleriand. Most significantly, they lent their aid to Beren and Dior (who dwelt on Tol Galen in the far south of their land). After the loss of their ancient ally Thingol at the hands of the Dwarves, they went with Beren to avenge him.  Much later, after the deaths of Beren and L&#250;thien, one of their lords took up the Silmaril that L&#250;thien had borne, and brought it to Menegroth where Dior now dwelt.After the end of the First Age, their fate is not clearly known.  Much of their land survived the destruction of Beleriand, and as Lindon came under the rule of Gil-galad.  Some at least seem to have removed to Eriador, as a note in the Unfinished Tales mentions Green-elves living on the shores of Lake Nenuial during the Second Age. After this, nothing is known of their fate.

Both his son Halfred and grandson Holman followed this same tradition, taking the surname Greenhand.  Holman Greenhand passed on his gardening skills to his distant cousin Hamfast Gamgee, and in turn Hamfast's son Sam took on the mantle of gardener in Hobbiton.

Finally, they passed through the border into the Eastfarthing, where they became densely wooded, and reached their eastern end at the appropriately named Woody End.

One of the chief towns of the Shire-hobbits, Tuckborough, lay among the western hills, and other villages were to be found among their slopes, or about their feet, including Tookbank, Woodhall and Pincup.

	Though Tolkien doesn't state this explicitly, 'grey' here clearly has a secondary meaning related to 'twilight'.  With the unique exception of Thingol himself, the Grey-elves are technically Dark Elves, Moriquendi, but they are also Eldar of the Great Journey who almost came to the Blessed Realm, and who spent millennia with a Maia as their Queen.  Of all the Elven kinds who remained in Middle-earth, the Grey-elves were the highest: it was partly for this reason that they are normally called 'Elves of the Twilight' rather than 'Dark Elves'.

	Apart from the details of his death (he was shot by hobbit archers in the Shire, after the Battle of Bywater) we have very little dating information about Gr&#237;ma.  Tolkien refers to only one other definite date connected to him: III 3014.  That was the year Th&#233;oden began to fall ill, and Gr&#237;ma began to gain a significant hold over him, though he had evidently been in the King's service for some time before this.

For all his genealogical importance, though, we know almost nothing of his life.  His dates of birth and death, though, show us that he was alive at the time of Smaug's Sack of Erebor, and the Battle of Nanduhirion twenty-nine years later.  It is more than likely that he was present at both these events.

	Gr&#243;r was born into the House of Durin during its last troubled years in the Grey Mountains.  He was the youngest of the three sons of King D&#225;in I, who ruled Durin's Folk during their wars with the dragons of the north.  When Gr&#243;r was just twenty-six years old, a cold-drake attacked D&#225;in's halls, and slew the King along with his second son, Fr&#243;r.The two remaining brothers resolved to flee the Grey Mountains with their people and settle elsewhere.  As the elder brother, Thr&#243;r inherited the Kingship, and led his people back to Erebor in the east. Young Gr&#243;r travelled still farther east, to the Iron Hills, where he founded a realm of his own.Gr&#243;r saw many mishaps and tragedies during his reign.  The kingdom of his brother Thr&#243;r was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, and Gr&#243;r's son and heir, N&#225;in, was killed at the Battle of Nanduhirion before he could inherit.  Gr&#243;r's rule passed instead to his grandson D&#225;in Ironfoot. Many years later, at the Battle of Five Armies,  Thr&#243;r's last descendant, Thorin Oakenshield, was lost.  D&#225;in inherited the high Kingship of Durin's Folk, a title that remained with the descendants of Gr&#243;r.Gr&#243;r ruled the Dwarves of the Iron Hills for two hundred and fifteen years, and was succeeded by his grandson D&#225;in.

	Those honoured guards of Minas Tirith who were charged with protecting the Citadel, the highest and most important tier of the city.  At the end of the Third Age, they were the only soldiers of the city to be liveried in the arms of Elendil himself - a white tree in blossom, surmounted by a silver crown and stars, all embroidered on a field of black.  They also bore heirlooms of Gondor's ancient wealth, tall helmets wrought out of mithril, and bearing the carved wings of sea-birds.  The numbers of these Guards is not known, but there seem to have been at least three companies (at least, one of their number - Beregond - is said in The Lord of the Rings to belong to the Third Company).
	In the past, they had watched over the White Tree that stood in the Court of the Fountation, though at the time of the War of the Ring, that Tree had been dead for nearly one hundred and fifty years.  After the War, the new King Aragorn Elessar, with the aid of Gandalf, found a new seedling of the Tree, and the Guards' great duty was refounded.

	&nbsp;&#149; Uinendili
	A guild of mariners and seamen formed by the great N&#250;men&#243;rean adventurer Aldarion in the year II 750.  The Guild had no fixed guildhouse on land, but was based instead on the ship E&#228;mbar, that had been built for the purpose.  E&#228;mbar was sailed at times to different harbours of N&#250;menor, but was normally anchored off the island of Tol Uinen in the bay of R&#243;menna.  The sailors of the Guild went much farther than this, though, steering their vessels east across the Great Sea to the distant shores of Middle-earth.  There, they visited Gil-galad in Lindon, and explored the coastlands into the far south.

Guilin
	[guilin.txt]
	A lord of Nargothrond
	A noble Elf of Nargothrond, the father of two sons, Gwindor and Gelmir.  Guilin himself makes no direct appearances in Tolkien's works.  The most we can say is that he doesn't appear to be dwelling where we'd expect him, in Nargothrond, in the later First Age, but the reason for this is a mystery.
	Though we know little of Guilin's life, his sons had a great impact on the history of the Elves.  It was Gwindor's desperation over the torture of his brother Gelmir that triggered the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and long after that dreadful battle he led T&#250;rin back to Nargothrond, starting a chain of events that would lead to its destruction.

	Notes
	1
	A pronunciation something like 'haydor' is perhaps more natural and common, but the harder 'hahdor' shown here follows the rules of Elvish pronunciation more precisely.  It may be relevant that older texts show the name accented, as 'H&#225;dor', though the significance of this accent (or of its removal) is not entirely clear.
	2
	'Thrower' is the literal meaning of Hador's name. In Elvish, the word hador refers to a warrior who fights with throwing weapons, such as spears or darts.

It was the fashion at this period of history for Gondor's Stewards to take their names from historical figures of the First Age, a fashion that would survive for four generations after Hador to his great-great-grandson Steward Boromir.  Hador himself was named for the great hero Hador L&#243;rindol, ancient Lord of Dor-l&#243;min.Little of note occurred during Hador's rule.  On the three hundredth anniversary of the Stewards' Reckoning, the calendar introduced by his ancestor Mardil, he added an extra day to the year to 'fine-tune' the calendar's accuracy.  Hador ruled during the time of the Watchful Peace, and so had no need to concern himself with matters of war, though his descendants would not be so fortunate.Hador ruled Gondor for one hundred and seventeen years, and was succeeded by his son Barahir.

	During the early years after they crossed the Blue Mountains, the Haladin dwelt happily in Caranthir's lands in Thargelion.  They lived a scattered, pastoral existence until one day a swarm of Orcs descended on them, without warning, out of the Blue Mountains to the east.Until that time, the Haladin had no single leader, but with the assault of the Orcs Haldad took on the role.  He gathered what remnant he could of his people, and built a defensive stockade between the rivers Gelion and Ascar, south of Sarn Athrad. There the Orcs besieged them until their food was exhausted.  Haldad led a sortie against the attacking Orcs, and was slain; his son Haldar rushed to recover his father's body, and was slain in turn.Haldad's death was not in vain; Haldad's daughter Haleth led the Haladin through another week of starvation and seige until Caranthir's army appeared out of the north, and drove the attacking Orcs to their deaths.

	In the histories of Middle-earth, there were a very few figures who shared descent from both Elves and Men.  There were three definite cases where a Man and an Elf produced half-elven children: those of Beren and L&#250;thien, Tuor and Idril; and Aragorn and Arwen.  There's also a possible fourth case, a little more obscure than the others: that of Imraz&#244;r and Mithrellas.
	As a title, Half-elven (Elvish Peredhil) is normally only applied to Elros and Elrond, the grandchildren of Tuor and Idril.  Like their parents E&#228;rendil and Elwing, these were each allowed to choose their own destinies.  Elros chose to live as a Mortal Man, and became Tar-Minyatur, the first King of N&#250;menor.  His brother Elrond chose the other path, to be considered an Elf, and remained in Middle-earth until the end of the Third Age.

Hallas
	[hallas.txt]
	The thirteenth Ruling Steward of Gondor
	The illustrious son and heir of Steward Cirion of Gondor, who first ruled in Minas Tirith while his father still lived, during the time of the war with the Balchoth.  Cirion went to fight in that war, and left Hallas in command of the City of Gondor.  In that war, too, Eorl brought his Northmen to the aid of Gondor, and after Gondor's enemies were defeated, Cirion gifted him the green land of Calenardhon as a reward.  Hallas was a witness to the Oath of Cirion and Eorl, in which the two leaders stood beside the Tomb of Elendil and promised a bond of friendship between their two nations.  It was Hallas, indeed, who renamed Calenardhon as Rohan, and gave its new people the name Rohirrim, Horse-lords.
	Little is recorded of Hallas after he succeeded his father as Steward.  He ruled Gondor in the time when Rohan was establishing itself - the Golden Hall of Meduseld was completed in the second year of his rule.  At the great feast to celebrate the raising of the Hall, King Brego's son Baldor made his rash promise to enter the Paths of the Dead, which led to his loss in the mountains.  It is even possible that Hallas was present in person at that feast, though no record exists to prove this.
	Hallas ruled Gondor for thirty-eight years, and was succeeded by his son, who became Steward H&#250;rin II.

	The dwellings of the Doomsman of the Valar, the mighty being properly called N&#225;mo, though he was more often given the name Mandos from his own halls.  The name comes from two Elvish words meaning 'prison' and 'fortress', and the Halls stood on the western shores of Valinor, looking out across the Encircling Sea.  They were said to grow in size as the World aged, and their walls were hung with the tapestries of N&#225;mo's spouse Vair&#235;, depicting all the events of unfolding history.
	It was to the Halls of Mandos that the spirits of Elves and Men were gathered to await their different fates, and so Mandos was given its common name of the Halls of Waiting.  After a time, the near-immortal Elves could be re-embodied, and return from the Halls to their kin in Aman.  Men had a different fate, a fate which, even among the Lords of Valinor, only Mandos and Manw&#235; truly understood.

	The Lord of the RingsAppendix A II, The House of Eorl
	The ninth King of Rohan was Helm son of Gram, a man of grim mood and great strength.  Among his vassals was named Freca, who was of distant kin to Helm, but it was said that the blood of Dunland also ran in his veins.  Though Helm did not trust Freca, he was still granted a place on the King's council.  One fateful day Freca rode to Edoras from his own lands on the banks of the Adorn with an escort of many men, and demanded that Helm give his daughter in marriage to Freca's son Wulf.  Outside the hall of Meduseld, Helm struck Freca a fatal blow with his great fist, and from that time on he was known to history as Helm Hammerhand.

	A shimmering crystal found by Thr&#225;in I beneath the Lonely Mountain of Erebor, and worked into a multifaceted round gemstone by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.  Prized as the Heart of the Mountain, it was kept in the Great Hall of Thr&#225;in beneath Erebor.  When the Kings of Durin's Folk removed to the Grey Mountains, they took the Arkenstone with them, but when Thr&#243;r led the Dwarves back to the Lonely Mountain, he returned the stone to the Great Hall.
	When Smaug descended on the Erebor and sacked it, Thr&#243;r escaped, but he was not able to rescue the stone, and it remained part of the Dragon's treasure-hoard for many years.  At last, Thr&#243;r's grandson Thorin returned out of exile in the west, but his companion Bilbo Baggins secretly took the Heart of the Mountain from the hoard, and passed it to the Men and Elves who had aided in Smaug's downfall.  They in turn used it in an attempt to negotiate a fair recompense from Thorin.  All disputes were laid aside when Bolg and his Orcs appeared, and the Battle of Five Armies was fought in which Thorin was slain.  The Heart of the Mountain was laid on his breast, in his tomb beneath the roots of Erebor where Thr&#225;in had found it long centuries before.

	A descendant of the first High King
	&quot;...a recognized descendant occupying a throne or lordship in the N&#250;men&#243;rean realms by virtue of this descent [from Elendil]...&quot;
	The full definition of 'Heir of Elendil'As given in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth IV 3, The Palant&#237;ri
	A title granted to those descended from Elendil, the founder of the Two Kingdoms in the late years of the Second Age.  In the North-kingdom of Arnor, whose rulers were descended through Elendil's elder son Isildur, its definition was simple: their rulers came from Elendil's direct male line, unbroken down to Aragorn himself.
	The political situation in the South-kingdom of Gondor was more complicated, because its first independent King, Meneldil, was not a direct heir of Elendil in the strictest sense, being the son of Isildur's younger brother An&#225;rion.  In Gondor, therefore, the title was taken to refer to any descendants of Elendil who ruled in their own stead, a convenience that allowed Gondor's Kings to represent themselves as true Heirs of Elendil.  This situation was complicated still further with the loss of Gondor's last King, E&#228;rnur.  After this point, the Stewards who took up the rule of Gondor acted in place of the heirs of Elendil, and took on the powers associated with the title.
	These complexities were resolved at the end of the Third Age with the enthronement of Aragorn, a true heir, as King of a Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor.

Inland Sea of Helcar
	[helcar.txt]
	An inland sea in the distant east of Middle-earth
	Location:
	The north and east of Middle-earth1
	Pronunciation:
	he'lkar
	Meaning:
	Derived from a stem khelek-, meaning 'ice-cold'
	The inland sea in the east of ancient Middle-earth, on the eastern shores of which lay Cuivi&#233;nen.  Orom&#235; led the Elves of the Great Journey around the northern end of this sea as they set out for Valinor.
	Notes
	1
	The only maps to show Helcar are early ones, and they tend to place it rather nearer the centre of the World than to the north.  However, the text of The Silmarillion states that '...that sea stood where aforetime the roots of the mountain of Illuin had been...' (Quenta Silmarillion 3), and that Illuin was raised '...near to the north of Middle-earth' ibid 1), so Tolkien's conception seems to have changed over time.  Interestingly, though it isn't mentioned in The Silmarillion, there seems to have been a corresponding southern sea, the Sea of Ringil, which was perhaps associated with the roots of Illuin's mate Ormal.

	The range of wooded hills that rose up above the western side of the River Narog, also called Taur-en-Faroth or simply the Faroth.  The name is translated in full as 'Hills of the Hunters', and it was among these hills that the stream of Ringwil rose and cascaded down into the main river.  In their steep eastern sides above the Narog, there was a network of caverns.  From ancient times, these Caverns of Narog had been home to Petty-dwarves who dwelt there in secret.
	After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, King Thingol described the Caverns to his kinsman Finrod, who chose that place to build his great underground fortress, Nargothrond.  What became of the Petty-dwarves at this time is not recorded, but at least some escaped to dwell in Amon R&#251;dh.  Finrod was aided in his building beneath the Faroth by their distant cousins, the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains, and it was they who gave him his famous surname, Felagund, Hewer of Caves.

	&nbsp;&#149; Northern D&#250;nedain
	&nbsp;&#149; Sceptre of N&#250;menor
	A title used by the D&#250;nedain for their ultimate ruler.  Normally, 'High King' would refer to a king who ruled over other lesser kings and lords, but this is not necessarily the case with the High King of the D&#250;nedain.  The term seems to date back to the early days of N&#250;menor, where Tar-Meneldur the fifth King was addressed as 'High King', though he had no other rulers in his service.The more common use of the title, though, came at the end of the Second Age, with the establishment of the Realms in Exile in Middle-earth.  In their earliest years, the Two Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor fell under the ultimate rule of one man, Elendil, who dwelt in Arnor as the High King.  The South-kingdom of Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons, but only under his suzerainty.With Elendil's loss in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, his elder son Isildur inherited the High Kingship. Isildur ruled for only two years, though, before he too was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. After his death, historical events conspired to separate the Two Kingdoms, each of which took Kings of their own.  The High Kingship should in principle have fallen on Isildur's heir Valandil, but in practice Valandil became King of Arnor only, and had no power over the South-kingdom.More than three thousand years were to pass before Aragorn reunited Elendil's realms.  In doing so, as the direct descendant of Isildur through many generations, he also resurrected the High Kingship.

High King of the Noldor

	A title of six lords of the Deep Elves
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Pre-First Age to II 3441
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Noldor
	The title of six Elf-lords of the Noldor.  They held titular rulership over all the Noldor of Middle-earth, though in practice circumstances prevented the effective use of this power until the time of the Last Alliance.  The Sons of F&#235;anor, in particular, while they acknowledged the Kingship, paid its bearer little heed; they preferred to follow their own policies under the general leadership of Maedhros.IFinw&#235;(ruled c.9,000 years before the beginning of the First Age)The first lord of the Noldor awoke at Cuivi&#233;nen and led his people into the West to dwell in Valinor.  He was slain by Morgoth at Formenos, and succeeded by his eldest son.IIF&#235;anor(ruled briefly during I 1)He led the host of the Noldor back to Middle-earth1 to avenge his father's death and recover the Silmarils from Morgoth.  He was slain in his assault on Angband.  After his death, the Kingship by right belonged to his eldest son Maedhros, but he refused it and the succession passed instead to F&#235;anor's half-brother2.IIIFingolfin(ruled 454 years to I 455)He dwelt to the northwest of Beleriand with his sons, and ruled the Noldor during the Siege of Angband.  When Morgoth broke the leaguer in the Dagor Bragollach, he rode in anger to the gates of Angband and died in single combat with Morgoth.  He was succeeded by his eldest son.IVFingon(ruled 16 years to I 471)His short reign was one of endless war with the forces of Morgoth.  With Maedhros, he prepared a final assault on Morgoth, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, which ended in disaster for the Noldor and Fingon's own death.  He was succeeded by his brother3.VTurgon(ruled 39 years to I 510)Turgon's kingship was titular indeed, for even his own kin did not know the location of his Hidden City of Gondolin.  Gondolin's location was discovered by Morgoth through the treachery of Maeglin, and Turgon died in its Fall.  After his death, the Kingship passed back to Fingon's line, to his only son.VIEreinion Gil-galad(ruled 3,514 years to II 3441)The last High King, Gil-galad held the Kingship longer than any of his forebears since Finw&#235;.  He formed the Last Alliance with Elendil, and died during the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r at the end of the Second Age.Gil-galad was the last High King; after his time the title is never used.  In order of succession, the Kingship would presumably have fallen on Turgon's descendants; E&#228;rendil (who was in the West and could not exercise it) or his eldest son Elrond (who never made claim to the Kingship).
	Notes
	1
	The succession of F&#235;anor was not acknowledged by all the Noldor; many took Fingolfin as their lord immediately after the loss of Finw&#235;.  Nonetheless, as natural heir to Finw&#235; and lord of a part of the Noldor, F&#235;anor is included in this list.
	2
	Some few of the Noldor remained in Valinor when F&#235;anor returned to Middle-earth; they took Fingolfin's brother Finarfin as their King.
	3
	It is nowhere explained why the succession should have fallen on Turgon at this point, rather than passing directly to Fingon's son Gil-galad.

	The site of Maedhros&#146; capital

	The Lay of Leithian, Canto X (late addition)in The History of Middle-earth vol. III, The Lays of Beleriand
	To the south of the wide plain of Lothlann, the northern mountain-fences of Beleriand gave way in the east to a lowland region.  The mountains ended in a jumble of low hills, surrounding a single bare hill with a broad, flat summit: the Hill of Himring.  From this cold place sprang the river known as Little Gelion, one of two sources that came together to form the long river Gelion that bordered East Beleriand.
	After the Return of the Noldor, Maedhros the eldest son of F&#235;anor came to the hill, and built the greatest of his citadels on its flat summit.  After this time, the guarded lands around the Hill of Himring became known as the March of Maedhros.  That citadel stood for many centuries, and withstood the onset of the Dagor Bragollach, that swept away many of the Elves' forces and defences.  It was apparently destroyed in the War of Wrath: at least, by the end of the Third Age, all that remained of the Hill of Himring was a solitary island, Himling, lying off the northwest coasts of Middle-earth.

Aragorn's grandfather Arador was slain by them in the hills north of Rivendell, and a company of these creatures were among the armies that Sauron loosed from the Morannon in the War of the Ring.In appearance they were man-like, but larger, and seem to have been covered with hard scales.  They were fearsome and vicious, bellowing like beasts as they stormed into battle, and beating their enemies down with great hammers.
	Notes
	1
	We know that there were trolls in the First Age, at least in the broad sense of the word, but our particular knowledge of hill-trolls derives from just two references.  In III 2930, Aragorn's grandfather Arador was slain by them among the northern Coldfells, and they were also seen in the battle before the gates of Mordor on 25 March III 3019.  This seems to show that they were relatively widespread in Middle-earth, at least at the end of the Third Age.

H&#237;rilorn
	[hirilorn.txt]
	The great beech of Doriath
	An immense beech-tree that grew close to the gates of Menegroth, the underground capital of King Thingol.  Its original name seems to have been Neldor, meaning 'triple-tree' because of its three tall straight trunks.  It is a mark of the tree's fame that its name ultimately became the Sindarin word for 'beech', from which was named the entire forest of Neldoreth, where it grew.
	Its name was changed at the time of the Quest of the Silmaril.  Concerned that his daughter L&#250;thien would risk danger seeking out Beren, Thingol had a house built among the branches of the great beech, and imprisoned L&#250;thien there.  After this time the tree's name was changed to H&#237;rilorn, meaning 'Tree of the Lady', though it did not hold L&#250;thien for long.  Using her magical arts, she escaped from H&#237;rilorn and set out to aid Beren in many adventures, eventually helping him to recover a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron Crown.
	As it had seen these first steps in the Quest, the mighty beech also saw its end: the Silmaril was finally recovered in the Hunting of the Wolf, but in that hunt Beren received a mortal wound, and it was beneath H&#237;rilorn's branches that L&#250;thien was briefly reunited with him before he died.

	It stands to reason that the name 'Hither Lands' would only make sense used by a speaker or writer within Middle-earth itself.  Beings who dwelt in the Blessed Realm of Aman, beyond the western shores of the Sea, used a different term: they called the lands over the Sea the Outer Lands.

	Cultures:
	Bree-hobbits, Bucklanders, Shire-hobbits
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Halflings, Holbytlan, Little People, Periannath
	Meaning:
	'Hole-builders', from the ancient Northern word, holbytlanSee The History of 'Hobbit' below
	A mortal race almost certainly related to Men, though their origins are unknown.  Their most distinguishing feature was their short stature; even the tallest Hobbits rarely exceeded four feet in height.Originally a widespread people, hobbits were found in much of the north of Middle-earth and down the Vales of Anduin.  As the Third Age passed, the Hobbits moved north and west, eventually founding the land of the Shire in III 1601.
	The History of &#145;Hobbit&#146;   "On a blank leaf I scrawled: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.' I did not and do not know why."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 163, to W.H. Auden, dated 1955This is Tolkien's own account of his invention of the word 'hobbit', while marking School Certificate papers: he gives no date, but from the clues he gives, this most likely happened one summer in the late 1920's.  This, then, is one of the most significant doodles in the history of literature: without it, there would have been no Hobbit, and without The Hobbit no Lord of the Rings, and without The Lord of the Rings, surely no Silmarillion.  If not for those ten scrawled words, the world might never have heard of J.R.R. Tolkien.On the face of it, the origins of 'hobbit' are easy to explain: a bored academic invents an amusing little word 'from nowhere' and jots it down.  As the word became well known, though, debates began about its origins.  Some doubt was even cast on whether Tolkien had invented the word himself.  Probably of more importance to Tolkien himself, though, was the history of 'hobbit' within his universe, and we'll address this question first.The Invented EtymologyWhy do hobbits call themselves 'hobbits'?  What is the history of the word within the world of Middle-earth?  These are questions that most writers wouldn't even consider, but they gave Tolkien a problem.  Most of his names for characters and places came from established languages, fictional or otherwise, and so they had a 'real' history in Tolkien's imagination that could be translated into his fictional world.  'Hobbit', though, had appeared spontaneously, and so had no history of its own.  Tolkien needed to invent one.In Middle-earth's past, the hobbits had dwelt in the northern reaches of the Vales of Anduin, and the language Tolkien used to represent that region was Old English, the tongue of the Anglo-Saxons.  His task, then, was to find words from Old English that might transform over millennia into the form 'hobbit'.The word hob (meaning 'sprite' or 'little man', as in hobgoblin) seems an obvious solution.  It's a mark of Tolkien's attention to detail that he didn't use it - the word is far too young (less than a thousand years old) and was unknown to the Anglo-Saxons. Hence, the Northmen of Middle-earth wouldn't have known hob either.The solution he chose was more sophisticated: he selected the Old English words hol byldan, or some similar variant, meaning 'to build a hole', and developed the fictional compound holbytla (plural holbytlan). It is easy to see how, over several thousand years, this could evolve into 'hobbit'.The success and ingenuity of this solution, though, hide one inconvenient detail: 'hole-builder' is, at best, a highly unconventional use of English.  One can no more 'build a hole' than one can 'dig a house'.  It's noticeable that Tolkien's later works tend to interpret holbytla as 'hole-dweller' rather than 'hole-builder'.  In particular, he submitted 'hole-dweller' to the Oxford English Dictionary (see The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 316).  We don't know what happened next - perhaps some sharp-eyed Anglo-Saxon-speaking researcher intervened - but the modern Dictionary  has reverted to the more strictly accurate 'hole-builder'.Who Invented 'Hobbit'?Almost as soon as The Hobbit was published, questions started to be asked about the real origins of the word.  Of course, Tolkien's use of it was his own invention, but was he definitely the first to use the word?  Perhaps it had already been invented by someone else?  Perhaps Tolkien had come across it in childhood and forgotten the event, only to have the word reappear from his subconscious years later?These questions seem to have originated with a letter written to The Observer newspaper, published on 16 January 1938 (see The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 25).  The author, known only by the punning pseudonym of Habit, claimed that a friend remembered a fairy-tale called The Hobbit dating from about 1904.  Other mentions of this tale (apparently about a rather ferocious creature) have surfaced since, with dates that vary around the turn of the twentieth century.Was there a hobbit before Tolkien's?  We just don't know.  So far as we can establish, no-one has yet produced a copy of this 'proto-hobbit'.  Tolkien himself, while not entirely dismissive of the idea, suggested that a similar-sounding title might have been misremembered in light of his own invented word.  If an earlier hobbit ever did exist, a century has passed since it was published, so the chances of finding any proof are negligible (though if you should happen across a copy, please let us know!).The last word on this topic came from the Oxford English Dictionary, when they decided to honour Tolkien by including 'hobbit' in their hallowed pages.  For the etymology, they needed to establish definitively when the word was first used.  Their conclusion effectively closes the matter:   "hobbit n. one of an imaginary race of half-sized persons in stories by Tolkien; hence ~RY (5) n. [invented by J.R.R. Tolkien, Engl. writer d. 1973, and said by him to mean 'hole-builder']"   The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English(If you have any old books in your attic, though, it might be worth leafing through them!)Of Hobs and BoggartsThroughout northern Europe, there exists a prevailing tradition of 'Little People'. They have an endless list of names: brownies, pixies, fays, leprechauns are just some of the more common.  In some regions, these beings are far more than just myths or folklore: even today, they have an effect on people's everyday lives.Take, for example, the Isle of Man in the middle of the Irish Sea: an island with a severe fairy infestation.  In the southern parts of the island is the 'Fairy Bridge', a bridge that no Manxman would cross without greeting the Little People that live there.  To most, of course, this is just superstition, but there are those who literally believe that they share their island with all manner of fairy creatures.  Among these is a being known as a phynnodderee; shy of humans, friendly and happy-go-lucky, hairy-legged, fond of wine and beer and given to farm-work.  Sound familiar?The Manx aren't alone, of course: from Germany, where miners are helped by friendly burrowing 'kobolds', all the way to Iceland, whose Elves occupy a ghostly realm curiously similar to Tolkien's 'wraith-world', there are similar traditions.What's more, even their names are familiar: we've already mentioned hob, but boggart, boggard, flibbertigibbet and even Hobberdy, Hobbidy and Hobberdy Dick (these last three are listed by Tolkien himself; The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 319, dated 1971).Perhaps surprisingly, Tolkien denies that he was influenced by this in choosing the name 'hobbit', but he seems to have embraced the tradition by the time he wrote the Foreword to The Lord of the Rings.  There, he says that hobbits are 'more numerous formerly than they are today', and that they 'avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find'.  We can only realistically see this as an attempt to marry his fictional people with the 'hobbits' of folklore and tradition.
	AddendumSince this article was written, we've discovered that the name 'hobbit' goes back far further than even Tolkien suspected.  We're indebted to Mark Blanton for sending along a long list of magical beings collected by a certain Michael Aislabie Denham before the year 1859.  In the middle of this list, among the 'boggleboes', 'freiths' and 'wirrikows' lies the term 'hobbits'.  Even more remarkably, the list predates even the nineteenth century - it was apparently taken from an even earlier work, Discovery of Witchcraft, dated 1584.
	A story that started with an idle note on a blank piece of paper has, in the end, taken us back through thousands of years of myth and language.  This is one of the great joys of Tolkien - his work has an almost 'fractal' quality.  The more you examine a single detail, the more it unravels into an epic mesh of connections and complexity.  The last word on this matter is best left to the master himself:   "Oh what a tangled web they weave who try a new word to conceive!"   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 319, dated 1971

	Meaning:
	A combination of hob and goblin, two old names for impish sprites
	&quot;Orc is not an English word.  It occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds)2&quot;
	Preface to The Hobbit
	A name for the larger kinds of Orc found in Middle-earth in the Third Age.  The term perhaps, but doubtfully, refers to the large soldier-orcs known as Uruks.The term appears so rarely that there is little clear basis for a definition.  Its only other occurrence is later in The Hobbit (7, Queer Lodgings) where Gandalf warns Bilbo that the Grey Mountains are 'simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description'.
	Notes
	1
	If 'hobgoblin' is just a general term for a large Orc, then their race is old indeed, predating the First Age.  If, much less certainly, it refers to the Uruk-hai, then their appearance is more recent: about III 2475. This is recent in terms of the history of Middle-earth, but still five centuries earlier than Bilbo's adventures in The Hobbit.
	2
	In fact, 'orcs' appears exactly twice in The Hobbit: once in Gandalf's warning, given above, and once in Chapter 5, Riddles in the Dark: '...even the big ones, orcs of the mountains, go along at great speed...'

Holman Greenhand
	[holmangreenhand.txt]
	One of a long line of Hobbiton gardeners
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	III 2892 to c.III 29611 (1292 - c.1361 by the Shire-reckoning, lived at least 69 years)
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Family:
	Greenhand
	Meaning:
	'Holman' means 'hole man'; 'Greenhand' comes from gardening tradition of the family
	HalfredGreenhandHOLMANGREENHAND
	The Greenhands were descended from Holman the greenhanded, and Holman's namesake and grandson, Holman Greenhand, was at least the third of the line to tend the gardens of Hobbiton.  Holman was the gardener at Bag End for Bilbo Baggins, and perhaps also for his father Bungo.  In about the year III 2941, he took on his young relation Hamfast Gamgee as an apprentice.  Hamfast eventually became the gardener at Bag End himself, and was followed by his son Samwise.In a curious and unlikely way, Holman was instrumental in the winning of the War of the Ring.  One morning in the spring of III 2941, Bag End was visited by the Wizard Gandalf.  Bilbo was away from home for the Elves' New Year, so Gandalf struck up a conversation with Holman.  It was Holman's description of his employer that encouraged Gandalf to include Bilbo in the journey to the Lonely Mountain, which in turn led to the finding of the One Ring, the means through which Sauron was ultimately defeated.  If not for the part of Holman Greenhand, then, the western lands might well have fallen under the yoke of the Dark Lord.
	Notes
	1
	The Longfather Tree of Master Samwise in Appendix C to The Lord of the Rings, shows us Holman's date of birth, but isn't specific about his lifespan.  There's a strong clue in the text of The Fellowship of the Ring, though, where we're told that Holman's successor, Hamfast Gamgee, had 'tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that.' (I 1 A Long-expected Party).  This text refers to the year of Bilbo's Birthday Party, III 3001, so we know that Holman stopped gardening at Bag End forty years earlier, in III 2961, when he would have been sixty-nine years old.  It's quite possible that he merely retired in that year, and lived on for a few years more, but III 2961 is the last specific date we hear of him.

	Ainur
	The host of spiritual beings brought into existence by Eru Il&#250;vatar before the beginning of the World.  The Holy Ones were better known by their Elvish name - Ainur - of which 'holy ones' is the English translation.  These Ainur were the agents through which Il&#250;vatar created Arda, through their making of a Great Music, but that Music, and the World that sprang from it, was marred by Melkor.  After seeing a vision of the new world, many of the Holy Ones desired to bring it to fruition, and bound themselves to it to guide its formation and growth.  The most powerful of these became the beings known as the Valar, while the many lesser spirits that came to their aid were the Maiar, and perhaps other orders as well.  Ranged against them were others, who had in the beginning been Holy Ones themselves, but who had fallen into darkness: the Dark Lord Melkor, his mighty follower Sauron, and many corrupted Maiar, including the demons known as Balrogs.

Frodo Baggins himself had Hornblower blood - his great-grandfather Largo married one Tanta Hornblower.  The meaning of this old family name is unclear; perhaps one of Tobold's ancestors actually did blow a horn of some kind, or perhaps the name is a punning reference to pipe-smoking.

	Notes
	1
	Belen is not mentioned by name in the published Silmarillion, though his existence is implied by a reference to Baran as B&#235;or's elder son.  His name is taken from an extremely detailed genealogy of the House of B&#235;or given in The War of the Jewels (volume 11 of The History of Middle-earth).  The status of this genealogy is unclear, and it should be noted that Belen's name is not necessarily canonical.
	2
	Like Belen (see note 1), Baranor's name does not appear in the published Silmarillion.  It is taken from the same source in The War of the Jewels, and included here to clarify the descent of Bereg.  In The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien notes that he was a grandson of Baran, but gives no further details, leaving open the possibility that he was a son of Boron.  In fact, according to the detailed genealogy (to which Christopher Tolkien seems to be referring), he belonged to a different branch of the House, descending from a son of Baran named Baranor.

House of Elendil
	[houseofelendil.txt]
	The line of the Kings of Gondor and Arnor
	Elendil the son of Amandil was one of the greatest heroes of Tolkien's tales.  With his two sons Isildur and An&#225;rion, he escaped the Downfall of N&#250;menor and founded two kingdoms in Middle-earth; Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south.  He ruled both of these as High King, and from his descendants came the line of Kings in both the North- and the South-kingdoms.Elendil himself was lost in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, and his elder son Isildur inherited the High Kingship.  Two years later, Isildur himself, together with his three elder heirs, was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.  His only remaining heir, Valandil, was only a boy, and so Arnor was effectively left without a King.  Thus, the House of Elendil split into two lines.  In the south, Isildur's nephew Meneldil had been left to rule Gondor in his uncle's name.  Meneldil now took up the full Kingship of Gondor, and it was ruled by his descendants for more than two thousand years.When Valandil came of age, he inherited the northern lands of his father, Arnor.  Valandil and his descendants ruled the North-kingdom for many generations, until dissent arose among the sons of the tenth King, E&#228;rendur.  This conflict ultimately saw Arnor divided into three kingdoms; Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur.  E&#228;rendur's eldest son and true heir, Amlaith, took control of Arthedain, while his brothers took up rule in the other new lands.  Arthedain endured for more than a thousand years, but eventually all three kingdoms of the Northern D&#250;nedain fell to the armies of Angmar.The line of Elendil was not broken in that defeat.  The heir of Arvedui, the last King of Arthedain, was Aranarth. He took the title Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain, and his descendants led a proud but scattered people through the last millennium of the Third Age.  The last Chieftain was Aranarth's heir through many generations: Aragorn, who united the Two Kingdoms after the War of the Ring and became the first King of the Reunited Kingdom.

	The cursed descendants and followers of F&#235;anor, the eldest son of Finw&#235;, and his spouse Nerdanel.  F&#235;anor was one of the greatest, and certainly the most skilled, of the Noldor, but his burning anger at the loss of his Silmarils led him to commit acts that would greatly diminish the influence of his house among his people.  As the heir of Finw&#235;, F&#235;anor and his descendants should have inherited the High Kingship of the Noldor, but because of F&#235;anor's rash acts, the lordship of the Noldor passed to his brothers: Finarfin in Aman, and Fingolfin in Middle-earth. For this reason, the members of the House of F&#235;anor are referred to as the Dispossessed.The history of the House was a woeful one, and most of its members met an early end.  F&#235;anor and six of his seven sons perished before the end of the First Age.  His second son Maglor survived beyond the War of Wrath, wandering the shores of Middle-earth, but his fate is unknown.  The last of the House was F&#235;anor's grandson Celebrimbor, the son of Curufin, who had a great part in the making of the Rings of Power, and was tortured to death by Sauron during the Second Age.

	The House of the descendants and followers of Fingolfin, second son of Finw&#235;, who was accounted High King of the Noldor after the death of his elder brother F&#235;anor in the first year of the First Age.During the early years of the First Age, the House of Fingolfin held the lands to the northwest of Beleriand; Hithlum, Nevrast and Gondolin.  Of these, the city of Gondolin held until I 510, but Hithlum was overrun by Morgoth in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where Fingon was slain (Fingolfin had already met his end in the Dagor Bragollach). The remnant of the House, including Fingon's son Ereinion Gil-galad, were succoured by C&#237;rdan the Shipwright in the Havens.After the Nirnaeth, Tuor son of Huor was sent as a messenger to Turgon in Gondolin, and there wedded Turgon's daughter Idril.  Thus was the blood of Men introduced into the House, and the descendants of their line were named half-elven, given the choice of whether they were to considered Men or Elves. All these descendants chose to be considered among the Firstborn, except Elrond's brother Elros (who became the first King of N&#250;menor and was a direct ancestor of Aragorn Elessar), and Elrond's daughter Arwen (Queen to Aragorn at the end of the Third Age).After the Fall of Gondolin, the survivors of the House lived as exiles at the Mouths of Sirion or in the Falas, until E&#228;rendil the Mariner, descendant of Fingolfin's second son Turgon, sailed into the West to seek the aid of the Valar, who overthrew Morgoth in the War of Wrath in c. I 583.The last High King of the Noldor, Ereinion Gil-galad, remained in Middle-earth.  He dwelt in Lindon with his great-nephew Elrond and C&#237;rdan the Shipwright, and marched with the Last Alliance to Mordor at the end of the Second Age.  There he fell in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, and the royal line of the House of Fingolfin came to an end in Middle-earth.

	The descendants of H&#250;rin of Emyn Arnen, the Steward to King Minardil of Gondor.  After H&#250;rin's time it became traditional for the Steward to be chosen from among his descendants, and ultimately the post became hereditary.  After the loss of Gondor's last King, E&#228;rnur, the Stewards of the House of H&#250;rin took up the rule of the South-kingdom.  Denethor, Boromir and Faramir were all descended from this House.

	The hilltop of Amon R&#251;dh had long been the home of a colony of Petty-dwarves, who lived in an underground complex originally known as Bar-en-Nibin-noeg, the 'House of the Petty-dwarves'.  As the First Age wore on, these people dwindled, until at last only three survived: M&#238;m and his two sons Kh&#238;m and Ibun.  To their misfortune, the Petty-dwarves encountered T&#250;rin at the time he led a desperate band of outlaws.  M&#238;m's sons fled, but M&#238;m himself was caught, and agreed to house the outlaws in exchange of his own life.  So the Dwarf-delvings of Amon R&#251;dh became known as Bar-en-Danwedh, meaning 'House of Ransom'.  The ransom, in fact, was a double one: when they returned to Amon R&#251;dh, it was learned that Kh&#238;m had been shot by an arrow as he fled, and was dead.  In recompense, T&#250;rin promised to pay M&#238;m a ransom of his own, if ever he was able.
	T&#250;rin and the outlaws stayed for more than a year in Bar-en-Danwedh, where they were joined by Beleg Strongbow out of Doriath.  They defended the lands around against Melkor's forces, and became so famous in that region that they gained a following, with T&#250;rin and Beleg coming to be known as the Two Captains.  In the end, though, disaster struck: M&#238;m betrayed them to the Orcs, who slew the outlaws and captured T&#250;rin in a net.  Beleg survived, and M&#238;m fled from him, never to return to his old House of Ransom on Amon R&#251;dh.

	A title given to both an Elf and a Man: to Mablung of Doriath in the First Age, and to Vorondil the Steward of Gondor in the Third.  The title is only used once of Mablung, and we know little of his hunting prowess beyond the fact that he was called by Thingol to take part in the Hunting of the Wolf.  It was Mablung who recovered Beren's severed hand from the belly of the Wolf Carcharoth, and was so surprised by its weight that he dropped it and the Silmaril it held.  This was the origin of Mablung's much more common epithet, Mablung of the Heavy Hand.
	Vorondil the Hunter lived more than five thousand years after Mablung's time.  He was the son of Steward Pelendur, and made his name in the east of Middle-earth, hunting the wild Kine of Araw that roamed the lands of Rh&#251;n.  He carried a great silver-bound hunting-horn taken from one of these monstrous oxen, which was to become an heirloom of the House of H&#250;rin, and would eventually be carried by Boromir on the Quest of Mount Doom.

	At the gates of Angband, the mighty wolf Carcharoth had bitten Beren's hand from his wrist, and with it the Silmaril it held.  The Silmaril was a hallowed jewel, and burned the innards of the evil monster.  In searing pain, the wolf blindly chased through Beleriand and, breaking the Girdle of Melian, roamed madly through the lands of Doriath.King Thingol set out to hunt the wolf with the greatest of his warriors.  With him went Mablung and Beleg, and Beren Erchamion, and Huan the Hound of Valinor.  They found Carcharoth under the eaves of Neldoreth, drinking beneath a waterfall of the River Esgalduin.  Eventually, after a mighty battle, Huan slew Carcharoth, but both he and Beren were mortally wounded.From the wolf's belly, Thingol recovered the Silmaril and carried it back to Menegroth.  This was the same jewel that E&#228;rendil would bear as he sailed to Aman and that, according to legend, now shines as the Evening and the Morning Star.

Huor

	Heroic grandfather of E&#228;rendil

	Division:
	Edain
	Culture:
	Men of Dor-l&#243;min

	Meaning:

	GaldorHarethH&#250;rinHUORR&#237;anTuor
	Younger son of Galdor, Lord of Dor-l&#243;min, and grandson of Hador L&#243;rindol, Huor was in his turn the father of Tuor and grandfather of E&#228;rendil the Mariner.  Huor had the fair hair and blue eyes of his grandfather's house, and was accounted one of the tallest of the Edain, second only to his own son Tuor.Following the custom of Men in those days, Huor and his elder brother H&#250;rin were fostered by their uncle Haldir, the lord of the Haladin of Brethil, and so they were dwelling in that forest at the time of the Dagor Bragollach in I 455. Though they were too young to go to open war (Huor was only thirteen years old at this time, and his brother sixteen), they went with the Haladin to destroy an orc-legion that had come to the forest.The orcs were routed, and the forest had peace for many years after, but Huor and his brother were cut off from the main force.  Ulmo sent a mist to aid their escape, and they retreated across the Brithiach into northern Dimbar, in the shadows of the Crissaegrim, the Encircling Mountains of Gondolin.  Seeing that they were lost and weary, Thorondor sent two of his eagles to rescue them, and they were carried over the mountains into Turgon's Hidden Kingdom.Ulmo had warned Turgon to look favourably on the Men of the House of Hador, and so he welcomed the brothers, and they stayed in Gondolin for nearly a year.  Although the law of Gondolin forbade any to leave who had entered the city, Turgon made an exception because the eagles had carried Huor and H&#250;rin, and so they had no clear idea where Gondolin lay.  The eagles carried them away, and they returned to the house of Galdor in Dor-l&#243;min. Turgon had bound them under an oath of silence, and it was never told where they had been for that year.When Huor had grown to manhood, he wedded R&#237;an the daughter of Belegund, and they conceived a son.  Huor named his son even before his birth, Tuor.  Two months after the wedding, the Elven-lords assembled a great army to assail Morgoth, and H&#250;rin and Huor went to join that army with the muster of Dor-l&#243;min.  This was the great battle that was to be called Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Unnumbered Tears.Huor stood with the forces of his brother under the walls of the tower of High King Fingon at Barad Eithel, and their armies were arrayed in the woods on the eastern slopes of the Ered Wethrin, so that Morgoth could not descry their numbers.  Turgon also came out of Gondolin with his armies for the first time since the city was built to join that battle.After six days of fighting, the battle turned to Morgoth and the Elves were routed.  Turgon retreated south to return to his halls in Gondolin, and Huor and H&#250;rin, with the remnant of the forces of Dor-l&#243;min, stood at his back to guard his withdrawal.  Before they parted, Huor prophesied to Turgon that new hope would spring from the two of them, saying '...from you and from me a new star will arise'.  This later proved to be true, for his son Tuor wedded Turgon's daughter Idril, and their son was E&#228;rendil the Blessed.Then came the last stand of the Men of Dor-l&#243;min, who held the Pass of Sirion against the hosts of orcs and creatures of the Enemy.  They gave slowly back until they came to the Fen of Serech and the stream of Rivil, and there they and their host stood firm.  As the day grew dark on that last desperate battle, Huor was slain, by a poisoned arrow in his eye.

	Species:

	Pronunciation:
	hoo'orns
	Meaning:
	Uncertain1
	Apparently a form of Ent that had lapsed into an almost complete tree-like existence.  Though they would rarely move of their own accord, and then only slowly,  they could be roused by the more active Ents, with whom they could also communicate.  The Huorns played a great part in the defeat of Saruman during the War of the Ring.
	Notes
	1
	The -orn element of the word 'huorn' must surely mean 'tree', but hu- is more mysterious.  It seems to be connected with the Huorns' power of communication, as Pippin says 'They still have voices, and can speak with the Ents - that is why they are called Huorns...' (The Two Towers III 9, Flotsam and Jetsam).  Two Elvish root-words that might possibly be connected here are h&#251;r ('active') and h&#251; ('dog'), but neither of these seem to sit easily with Pippin's words above.

	Notes
	1
	The date of H&#250;rin's death is somewhat uncertain.  He was captured in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in I 471, and we know that he was a prisoner in Angband for twenty-eight years, meaning that he must have been released in I 499.  From there, he travelled to the ruin of Nargothrond, then to Menegroth, and finally cast himself into the Sea.  The date of c. I 500 assumes that he took about a year to complete these travels.
	2
	The Etymologies (in volume 5 of The History of Middle-earth) explains that H&#250;rin's name comes from two Elvish roots, one meaning 'vigour, urgency', and the other meaning 'thoughtfulness, desire'.  'Vigorous-wise' is a fairly literal interpretation of these broad roots, and something like 'he who desires action' is by no means impossible as an alternative.

	&nbsp;&#149; King of Gondor
	&nbsp;&#149; Minardil
	H&#250;rin of Emyn Arnen is the earliest of Gondor's Stewards to have his name recorded in history.  He served under King Minardil, and though we know little of his life, it is certain that his actions had a tremendous effect on the future history of Middle-earth.  He was a Man of noble N&#250;men&#243;rean descent, the founder of the House of H&#250;rin from which Minardil's heirs came by tradition to select their own Stewards.  By the time of the loss of Gondor's last King, E&#228;rnur, some four centuries later, the Stewardship had become a powerful hereditary institution, ready to take over in place of the Kings.To lay the groundwork for such an achievement, H&#250;rin must have provided some great service to the state of Gondor, but what that service might have been is not hinted at in The Lord of the Rings.  However, the untimely death of his King, Minardil, followed almost immediately by the ravages of the Dark Plague, leave room for speculation that it was the efforts of H&#250;rin that directed Gondor through this dark time in its history.  A short passage in The History of Middle-earth seems to confirm this: '...[H&#250;rin] had laboured greatly for the ordering of the realm in the disastrous days of the plague, when King Telemnar died within two years of the slaying of King Minardil by the Corsairs.' (Vol. XII The Peoples of Middle-earth I 7 The Heirs of Elendil).

	When M&#238;m and his sons Ibun and Kh&#238;m were set upon by T&#250;rin's outlaw band, the two brothers fled into the mist.  As they ran, Kh&#238;m was shot by a wild arrow from the outlaws, but Ibun survived, and shared his father's House of Ransom with T&#250;rin and the outlaws.  One winter, the two Petty-dwarves went out in search of roots, and were captured by a band of Orcs.
	We know that M&#238;m survived his capture by betraying T&#250;rin to the Orcs, but Ibun's fate is unclear.  Much later, in Nargothrond, M&#238;m told H&#250;rin, 'I am the last of my people' 1, so Ibun cannot have survived to that time.  Whether he lost his life at the hands of the Orcs, or in some later unrecorded mishap, is not known.

	The Prince of Dol Amroth at the time of the War of the Ring, who fought at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and marched on Mordor with the host of Aragorn II Elessar.
	Notes
	1
	Biographical information about Imrahil is quite limited in the canonical sources, and some of that shown here comes from Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth and, especially, The Peoples of Middle-earth (The History of Middle-earth vol 12, I VII The Line of Dol Amroth).  This represents a draft of the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, and contains extensive information that did not appear in the published version.The dates of Imrahil's birth and death, and the details of his three children Elphir (who himself became Prince of Dol Amroth), Elchirion and Amrothos are not mentioned outside this source.  Although they are entirely consistent with the published texts, they cannot therefore be considered fully canonical.
	2
	The line of the Princes of Dol Amroth, though they were certainly Men, in fact claimed a measure of Elvish blood. It was claimed that the first Prince, Galador, was half-elven: his father was Imraz&#244;r the N&#250;men&#243;rean, but his mother was an Elf-maid, Mithrellas.  Imrahil was Galador's direct descendant through twenty-one generations, and so could himself claim distant descent from Mithrellas.Tolkien makes it clear that this was a tradition in Dol Amroth, and not necessarily a true story.  According to the legend, Mithrellas was a companion of Nimrodel, who became lost in the woodlands of Belfalas, and was taken in by Imraz&#244;r.  As far as they go, these details match the established history of Nimrodel's journey. Unions of Elf and Man, though, are all but unheard of in Tolkien's universe, and are always of vital historical importance. The Princes' claims of Elven descent, while they are not certainly false, are difficult to accept without scepticism.

	Notes
	1
	The meaning of Inc&#225;nus is a question that Tolkien addressed differently at different times. Its ultimate origin seems to have been the Latin word inc&#225;nus, meaning 'grey', or 'grey-haired'. Latin being rather inappropriate to Middle-earth, Tolkien reinterpreted it variously as a Westron word meaning 'Greymantle', or as an Elvish name, suggesting both 'north spy' and 'mind ruler' as possible meanings. This last, from in(id) 'mind' and kan- 'ruler', seems to have been his preference, though it is difficult to state this with certainty.

	The significance of the element ing-, 'first', in Ingw&#235;'s name is unclear.   It may be that he was the first of the Elves to awaken at Cuivi&#233;nen, or the first to set foot in the Undying Lands.  Alternatively, his name may simply mean 'foremost one', in reference to his exalted position as High King of all the Elves.

	Isildur was the eldest son of Elendil, and so by right he and his heirs should have inherited the title of High King and ruled the Two Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.  Soon after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, though, Isildur and his three elder sons all perished in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.Isildur's only remaining Heir was Valandil, kept safe in Rivendell but only eleven years old at that time, and unable to take up his rule. So, Isildur's nephew Meneldil took control of the kingdom of Gondor, and the Two Kingdoms split from one another.  In the south, Gondor remained strong under the rule of Meneldil's descendants, but the North-kingdom was not so fortunate.  It broke into three separate kingdoms, and was slowly overcome by dark forces of the neighbouring land of Angmar.  Arvedui, Isildur's Heir through twenty-three generations, was the last King to rule in the north; he attempted to reclaim the High Kingship, but failed, and the last remnant of royal Arnor was overrun by its enemies.Now the line of Isildur in the north became forgotten by nearly all.  Though their royal cities were wasted, and their people dwindled, the line of Isildur's Heirs continued for another sixteen generations under the title 'Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain'.  The last Chieftain was Aragorn II of the War of the Ring, who famously came to Minas Tirith and reclaimed the High Kingship of all the western lands.

	The lands of Gondor east of the River Anduin, on the borders of Mordor.  With the capture of Minas Ithil, and the return of the Nazg&#251;l to the Black Land, Ithilien became a deserted country.
	Notes
	1
	Minas Ithil is the only named city of Ithilien.  However, this rich land was at one time a populous region, and doubtless supported many other towns and settlements.  The hills of Emyn Arnen seem to have been of particular importance, though no individual settlements among the hills are ever named.

	Notes
	1
	The meaning of 'Khand' is never explained by Tolkien.  One possible explanation, though, lies in khand, a word from several interrelated south Asian languages, meaning 'realm' or 'land'.  The existence of this word may be no more than a strange coincidence, but the suitability of its meaning for a far southern realm of Middle-earth is striking, and the use of real languages as a basis for place-names is a common feature of Tolkien's work.

	The Black Chasm, The Black Pit, Dwarrowdelf, Hadhodrond, Moria, Phurunargian
	The geography of Khazad-d&#251;m1
	The grandest and most famous of the mansions of the Dwarves.  It lay in the central parts of the Misty Mountains, tunnelled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves, so that a traveller could pass through it from the west of the range to the east.  It was founded in very ancient days by Durin the Deathless, who came upon a shimmering lake beneath the mountain Celebdil, with a crown of stars reflected in its waters.  He named that lake in the Dwarvish tongue, Kheled-z&#226;ram, the Mirrormere, and there he started the building of Khazad-d&#251;m.As the millennia passed, the descendants of Durin sat upon the throne of Khazad-d&#251;m, and their cavernous city became famous throughout the world.  It even has a passing mention in Quenta Silmarillion, the tale of the Elf-lords and their wars far to the west, though to them it was no more than a distant rumour they heard from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains on their borders.  In the Second Age, Noldor out of Lindon founded a country of their own by the western gates of Khazad-d&#251;m.  A rare friendship sprang up between the Dwarves and the Elves of this new land, Eregion.  Eregion's ruler, Celebrimbor, helped to construct the famous and magical gate that became known as the West-gate of Moria, and indeed went so far as to present King Durin III with a Ring of Power.  The friendship of Khazad-d&#251;m and Eregion came to a sudden end, though, in II 1697, when Sauron overran the country of the Elves, and the doors of Khazad-d&#251;m were sealed against his forces.Eventually, Sauron was driven back and Khazad-d&#251;m continued to thrive.  Much of its great wealth was based on the mithril that was found in its mines, and as the centuries passed, the Dwarves mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal.  In the year III 1980, they dug too deep, and unleashed a nameless terror from the depths beneath the city.  The creature wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the then King, Durin VI, became known as Durin's Bane.  In the following year, Durin's son, N&#225;in I, was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home.  After millennia as one of the richest cities in Middle-earth, Khazad-d&#251;m stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Dwarves had released.  In that time it was given a new name, Moria, the Black Pit.The monster of Moria - a Balrog of Morgoth, as was later known - lurked alone in Moria for nearly five hundred years.  After that time, the old city of Khazad-d&#251;m began to be peopled again, but not by Dwarves.  Sauron directed his creatures there, and it began to fill with orcs and trolls.  Though the orcs' numbers were greatly reduced in the Battle of Nanduhirion, fought in the valley beneath Moria's East-gate in III 2799, the Balrog could not be bested, and Khazad-d&#251;m remained a citadel of darkness.There were two attempts by the Dwarves of Durin's line to reclaim their ancient home.  The first of these was by Balin, who led a force of Dwarves there from Erebor in III 2989, but though he was successful at first, he was eventually defeated and slain.  The story of the second attempt to recolonise the Dwarf-mansions is less clear3, but it seems that after several centuries, Durin VII became King of Durin's Folk, and led a further return to the citadel.  It seems he was successful, so that long after the War of the Ring, the Dwarves of Durin's line reclaimed their inheritance, and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains.
	Notes
	1
	Elements of this map are conjectural - we are never explicitly given, for example, the route of the Redhorn Pass, nor do we know for certain which of the Mountains of Moria was which.  Given the text of The Lord of the Rings, though, the layout cannot have varied much from that shown here.
	2
	Tolkien gives us little information about the pronunciation of Dwarvish names.  With the exception of the note regarding 'k-h', this pronunciation is conjectural.
	3
	In fact, the story of the eventual recolonisation of Moria does not appear outside the drafts for the appendices to The Lord of the Rings, so we cannot be completely certain that Tolkien intended it to stand.

	The Dwarves' name for their own secret language, of which only a few words were ever discovered by outsiders.  With the exception of a few fragments and place-names, Tolkien gives us little insight into the Dwarvish tongue (as the Dwarves kept their tongue secret, it is natural that little of it should have survived in records).  Our main sources are in words such as Khazad-d&#251;m (Khaz&#226;d being Dwarvish for 'Dwarves') and Khuzdul itself, and in the Dwarvish war-cry, 'Baruk Khaz&#226;d!  Khaz&#226;d aim&#234;nu!' ('Axes of the Dwarves!  The Dwarves are upon you!).During the Third Age, the Dwarves seem to have considered Khuzdul in much the same way as the Elves of Middle-earth looked on Quenya, as an ancient and noble tongue of the past.  The Dwarves would more commonly speak, even among themselves, in the native tongues of the regions in which they lived, to the extent that they took their names from these languages.The Dwarves also had secret 'inner' names, presumably derived from the Khuzdul tongue, but they were extremely secretive about these, to the extent that they were not even given on their owners' tombs.

	Those who held the title 'King of Durin's Folk' are shown in BLOCK CAPITALS.
	Title given to Durin the Deathless and his descendants who ruled the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.  Famous among these were Thorin II Oakenshield, who reclaimed Erebor from Smaug, and D&#225;in II Ironfoot, who fought in the War of the Ring.No complete list of the Kings is known.  The table below shows the names of those Kings who have been recorded, or whose existence can be deduced.  As the descendants of Durin were forced by circumstance to travel widely in Middle-earth, the main seat(s) of their Kingship is shown alongside each King.Durin IKhazad-d&#251;mOne of the seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and the founder of the Longbeards, Durin's Folk.  He ruled his people for centuries - so long, in fact, that he became known as the 'Durin the Deathless' - but eventually he passed away.  From time to time over the millennia, one among Durin's descendants would arise so similar in bearing to his ancient ancestor that he, too, would be given the name 'Durin'.Durin IIKhazad-d&#251;mWe know nothing of this King, except that the appearance of his descendant Durin III in the middle years of the Second Age shows that he must have ruled in Khazad-d&#251;m at some time before that.Durin IIIKhazad-d&#251;mThe ruler of Khazad-d&#251;m at the time of the forging of the Rings of Power, Durin III was a great friend of Celebrimbor the Lord of Eregion to the west. He received one of the Rings (later known as the Ring of Thr&#243;r) as a gift from his friend.Durin IVDurin VKhazad-d&#251;mLike Durin II, we know nothing of the reigns of these two Kings, except that they must have ruled during the late Second Age or earlier Third Age.  We can safely deduce their existence because we know that Durin VI took the throne in the late second millennium of the Third Age.Durin VIKhazad-d&#251;m(Ruled to III 1980) The first King of Durin's Folk for whom we have specific dates was Durin VI, who ruled in Khazad-d&#251;m at the time the Balrog was awoken.  It slew Durin, for which reason it became known as Durin's Bane.  Durin was succeeded briefly by his son.N&#225;in IKhazad-d&#251;m(Ruled 1 year to III 1981) He ruled for just a year in Khazad-d&#251;m before he too was slain by the Balrog.  He was succeeded by his son.Thr&#225;in IErebor(Ruled 209 years to III 2190) He led a great part of his people away from Khazad-d&#251;m into the north and east of Middle-earth.  It was Thr&#225;in who founded the great Dwarf-kingdom of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain above the Long Lake.  He was succeeded by his son.Thorin IGrey Mountains(Ruled 99 years to III 2289) Discerning that the great host of his people were gathering in the northern range of the Grey Mountains, Thorin I abandoned Erebor and removed there.  He was succeeded by his son.Gl&#243;inGrey Mountains(Ruled 96 years to III 2385) He continued the rule of Durin's Folk in the Grey Mountains, and was succeeded by his son.&#211;inGrey Mountains(Ruled 103 years to III 2488) He was succeeded by his son.N&#225;in IIGrey Mountains(Ruled 97 years to III 2585) In his time, the prosperous Dwarves began to suffer attacks by the dragons of the north.  He was succeeded by his son.D&#225;in IGrey Mountains(Ruled 4 years to III 2589) His short reign came to a swift end when he was slain by a cold-drake before his own doors.  He was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons.Thr&#243;rErebor(Ruled 201 years to III 2790) He led his people out of the dragon-infested north back to the Lonely Mountain, while his younger brother Gr&#243;r led some part of their people further east, to settle in the Iron Hills.  He had been King under the Mountain for more than 180 years when the great dragon Smaug descended on his kingdom and sacked it.  He escaped the destruction with his son and grandson, and went wandering in the wild.  Eventually reaching his people's ancient home of Khazad-d&#251;m, he found it infested with Orcs.  His death at the hands of their leader, Azog, sparked the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.  He was succeeded by his son.Thr&#225;in IIDunlandBlue Mountains(Ruled 60 years to III 2850) He avenged his father's death with the defeat of Azog's Orcs at the Battle of Azanulbizar.  In the early part of his reign, he dwelt in Dunland, but he later moved northward to the Blue Mountains west of Eriador.  Before his reign ended, he resolved to return to Erebor, but wandering in the wild he was captured by evil things, and died in the dungeons of the Necromancer.  He was succeeded by his eldest son.Thorin IIBlue Mountains(Ruled 91 years to III 2941) He ruled as King in the Blue Mountains for many years, but like his father before him he at last determined to return to his ancient home of Erebor.  Accompanied by Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, he led a troop of companions into the far east, and against all hope recovered the Lonely Mountain from Smaug.  After Smaug's death, the Battle of Five Armies was fought beneath Erebor, and Thorin was slain.  The only remaining descendants of Thr&#243;r's line, Thorin's young nephews F&#237;li and K&#237;li, were also lost in the battle.  So the descent of the Kingship passed to the line of Thr&#243;r's younger brother Gr&#243;r, and specifically to Gr&#243;r's grandson D&#225;in Ironfoot.D&#225;in IIErebor(Ruled 78 years to III 3019) He ruled in prosperity as King under the Mountain for many years until the time of the War of the Ring. He was slain in that war, in the Battle of Dale, and succeeded by his son.Thorin IIIEreborHe was besieged in Erebor for seven days after the loss of his father, but when news reached the forces of Sauron that their master had been defeated, he was able to drive them back.  With Thorin III, detailed records of the reigns of the Kings come to an end, but we have a record of just one of his descendants.Durin VIIKhazad-d&#251;m?He was said to be the last of the Durins to rule over Durin's Folk.  Durin's Bane had been destroyed in the War of the Ring, so that Khazad-d&#251;m lay open for recovery by its ancient owners, and there is some evidence that it was Durin VII who at last achieved this.We know that Durin I died before the end of the First Age, so that between his rule and that of Thorin III, the Kings of Durin's line ruled for a period of about 6,500 years.  Given that the average length of a reign among the Longbeards seems to have been roughly a century, we can deduce that there are probably about fifty Kings' names missing from this list.

	A title given to Thorondor
	A title given to Thorondor, the gigantic and noble eagle of the First Age, whose talons wounded the face of Morgoth himself.  Thorondor dwelt among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, guarding Turgon's Hidden City of Gondolin from the forces of Morgoth until that city's Fall, and he came to the aid of the Elves many times during the First Age.
	In The Hobbit, we meet a character who carries the title 'Lord of Eagles', a title that was also borne by Thorondor in the Elder Days.  Whether the title of 'King of Eagles' was also passed down through the Ages like this cannot be known - in Tolkien's writings, it is only ever used of Thorondor himself.

	Title&nbsp;of:
	Elendil and at least thirty-four of his descendants
	The title of the lords of the D&#250;nedain, Elendil and his descendants, who ruled the Kingdom of Gondor.  The line of the Kings came to an end when E&#228;rnur answered the challenge of the Lord of the Nazg&#251;l and was lost in Minas Morgul.  After his loss, Gondor was ruled by hereditary Stewards until the installation of Aragorn II Elessar (a direct descendant of Elendil) after the War of the Ring.IElendil(Ruled for 121 years to II 3441)He founded both Arnor and Gondor, and ruled the two kingdoms as High King.  His royal seat was in his own capital in the north, Ann&#250;minas, and during his reign, Gondor was under the direct command of his two sons, Isildur and An&#225;rion.  He formed the Last Alliance, and marched to the defeat of Sauron, but he himself was lost in that great victory.IIIsildur(Ruled for 2 years to III 2)He succeeded his father as High King, but before departing into the north, spent time ordering the South-kingdom.  In the second year of the Third Age, he left Gondor in the care of his nephew Meneldil, the son of his brother An&#225;rion, and rode away into the north.  On his journey, Isildur was ambushed by Orcs and slain, and so the Kingship of Gondor passed on to Meneldil and his heirs.IIIMeneldil(Ruled for 156 years to III 158)Isildur was lost with his three eldest sons, leaving just his fourth son Valandil, then a mere boy, as heir.  At this time Meneldil took on the full Kingship of Gondor, and its Kings through the next thirty generations would be his descendants.IVCemendur(Ruled for 80 years to III 238)VE&#228;rendil(Ruled for 86 years to III 324)VIAnardil(Ruled for 87 years to III 411)VIIOstoher(Ruled for 81 years to III 492)Ostoher rebuilt and expanded Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith) and took it for his summer residence.  During his reign Gondor began to suffer attacks out of the wild eastern lands.VIIIR&#243;mendacil I(Ruled for 49 years to III 541)He defeated the Easterlings, and took the name R&#243;mendacil - 'East-victor' - in token of this.  Nonetheless he met his death in renewed attacks by the Wild Men out of the East.IXTurambar(Ruled for 126 years to III 667)Turambar avenged his father's death, and won wide lands for Gondor in the east.XAtanatar I(Ruled for 81 years to III 748)XISiriondil(Ruled for 82 years to III 830)XIITarannon Falastur(Ruled for 83 years to III 913)The first of the four Ship-kings, Tarannon put his energies into the building of Gondor's navies.  His Queen, Ber&#250;thiel, was sent into exile, and so he was the first of Gondor's Kings to die childless.  He was succeeded by his nephew, the son of his brother Tarciryan.XIIIE&#228;rnil I(Ruled for 23 years to III 936)The second Ship-king famously captured the southern Haven of Umbar for Gondor, expanding its boundaries even farther.  He was lost in a storm off the very coasts he had conquered.XIVCiryandil(Ruled for 79 years to III 1015)In Ciryandil's time, the Haradrim came against Umbar, and the King died in its defence.XVHyarmendacil I(Ruled for 134 years to III 1149)He avenged his father's death, and pressed on to capture land in the south for Gondor, extending its borders to their greatest extent in history.XVIAtanatar II(Ruled for 77 years to III 1226)Because of the extent and wealth of his realm, he was called Alcarin, Atanatar the Glorious, though he lacked the adventuring warrior spirit of his predecessors.XVIINarmacil I(Ruled for 68 years to III 1294)Narmacil tired of the cares of Kingship, and appointed a Regent to manage the Kingdom for him.  This was his nephew Minalcar, who would one day rule in his own stead as R&#243;mendacil II.  He died without issue, and was succeeded instead by his younger brother.XVIIICalmacil(Ruled for 10 years to III 1304)Throughout his brief reign, his son Minalcar maintained his role as Regent.XIXR&#243;mendacil II(Ruled for 62 years to III 1366)After sixty-four years as Regent, Minalcar took the throne in his own right.  In memory of a great victory over the Easterlings he had won in his Regency, he became King in the name R&#243;mendacil II.He made diplomatic efforts in the east, allying himself with tribes of Northmen in Rhovanion as a bulwark against further Easterling invasions.  He sent his son Valacar as an ambassador to the Northmen, and while R&#243;mendacil still held the throne, Valacar wedded Vidumavi in the east, who bore him a son.XXValacar(Ruled for 66 years to III 1432)Valacar was a controversial and disputed King, especially because his heir carried the blood of the Northmen.  In the later part of Valacar's reign, true rebellion broke out, and the southern provinces of Gondor began to break away.XXIEldacar(Ruled intermittently for 48 years to III 1490)After the half-Gondorian Eldacar took the throne, the rebellions of Valacar's time grew into a full civil war, and after five years as King Eldacar was deposed by Castamir the Usurper.  For ten years he hid in the east, gathering his forces, and then challenged Castamir for his rightful Kingship, slaying the Usurper himself.  After regaining his throne, he reigned for another forty-three years before his death.XXIICastamir(Ruled for 10 years to III 1447)The Usurper of Eldacar's throne was descended from the royal line (he was the great-grandson of Calmacil) and is considered a King of Gondor in his own right.  He reigned for just ten years, as unrest among his subjects grew, after which Eldacar attacked from the east and reclaimed the throne of Gondor.XXIIIAldamir(Ruled for 50 years to III 1540)Aldamir was the younger son of Eldacar (his elder brother Ornendil had been put to death by Castamir).  In his time there was war in Gondor with the peoples of the south, and Aldamir fell in that war.XXIVHyarmendacil II(Ruled for 81 years to III 1621)Aldamir's son avenged his father by overcoming the Haradrim, and in token of this took the name of Hyarmendacil, 'South-victor', the second of Gondor's Kings to bear that auspicious name.XXVMinardil(Ruled for 13 years to III 1634)Minardil's was a brief reign.  He was at the port of Pelargir when it fell under attack by the Corsairs of Umbar, and he was slain in that attack.XXVITelemnar(Ruled for 2 years to III 1636)Telemnar's reign was even shorter than that of his father.  He was lost with all his children in the Dark Plague, and his line came to an end.XXVIITarondor(Ruled for 162 years to III 1798)Tarondor came early to the Kingship, and enjoyed the longest rule of any of Gondor's Kings.  His realm had been devastated by war and plague, and he worked to rebuild its power.  It was Tarondor who moved the King's House from Osgiliath to Minas Anor.XXVIIITelumehtar Umbardacil(Ruled for 52 years to III 1850)Telumehtar is most remembered by history as the King who reconquered Umbar to the south, and from this deed he took his name Umbardacil 'Victor over Umbar'.XXIXNarmacil II(Ruled for 6 years to III 1856)In Narmacil's time, Gondor's wars with the fierce Wainriders began; they emerged suddenly out of the east, and Narmacil's short reign came to an end in their violent assault.XXXCalimehtar(Ruled for 80 years to III 1936)Calimehtar reversed his father's defeat, and secured a famous victory over the Wainriders on the plain of Dagorlad.  Nonetheless they were not destroyed, and their threat remained on Gondor's eastern borders.XXXIOndoher(Ruled for 8 years to III 1944)Like his father and grandfather before him, Ondoher went to war with the Wainriders.  They had made alliance with the Men of Khand and of Harad, so that all of Gondor's bitterest foes attacked at one time.  Under its great general E&#228;rnil, Gondor had the victory at the Battle of the Camp, but Ondoher was lost in those wars, as were his two sons Artamir and Faramir.Interregnum(1 year to III 1945)After the loss of Ondoher and his sons, Gondor was left without a clear heir to its throne.  Arvedui of Arthedain made a claim, based on his descent from Isildur, but this claim was rejected.  Instead, the Crown was given to the commander who had saved the South-kingdom, E&#228;rnil, who as a great-great-grandson of Telumehtar was properly a member of the Royal House.XXXIIE&#228;rnil II(Ruled for 98 years to III 2043)E&#228;rnil ruled Gondor during a time a turmoil across Middle-earth.  In the north, the last kingdom of the D&#250;nedain was overrun by the Witch-king, and though E&#228;rnil's son E&#228;rnur travelled north to the aid of Arthedain, he came too late, though he did achieve the destruction of Angmar.  The Lord of the Nazg&#251;l returned to Mordor from that defeat, and later in E&#228;rnil's reign the Nazg&#251;l launched an assault on Minas Ithil, Gondor's great citadel on the borders of Mordor, and captured it.  After that time Minas Ithil was known as Minas Morgul, and Minas Anor as Minas Tirith.XXXIIIE&#228;rnur(Ruled for 7 years to III 2050)E&#228;rnur had reigned for just seven years when he foolishly took up a challenge from the Lord of the Nazg&#251;l, and rode willingly to Minas Morgul.  He was never heard from again, and his loss left Gondor without a King once more.Interregnum(969 years to III 3019)For nearly a millennium after E&#228;rnur's loss, Gondor had no King.  It was ruled by the Stewards, the loyal hereditary servants of the Kings descended from H&#250;rin of Emyn Arnen, Steward to King Minardil.  There were twenty-six Ruling Stewards, from Mardil Voronw&#235; to Denethor II, in whose time one came to Gondor with a true claim to its Kingship.XXXIVAragorn Elessar(Ruled for 122 years to IV 120)Aragorn was the long-lost Heir of Isildur out of the north, the direct descendant of Gondor's first and second Kings, who came into his title at the time of the War of the Ring, and was crowned in the year of the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r. He reunited the North- and South-Kingdoms; his Queen was Arwen, the daughter of Elrond, and his heir was their son Eldarion.XXXVEldarion(Ruled from IV 120)Little is known of Aragorn's son Eldarion but his name, and the fact that he succeeded his father to carry the royal line on into the Fourth Age.

It might also have been applied to Aragorn's distant ancestors Elendil and Isildur, both of whom had ruled the Two Kingdoms as High King of the D&#250;nedain long before Aragorn's time, but there is no record of either of them using the title.

	&nbsp;&#149; Narvi
	The title taken by the rulers of Khazad-d&#251;m, the greatest and most opulent Dwarf-city of all time.  The Kings were descended in line from Durin I, called the Deathless, who founded the city in ancient days.After the foundation of the line by Durin, little is said of the most ancient Kings.  What records we have show that they ruled, on average, for about a century each, which would mean that there must have been very roughly sixty generations of Kings of Khazad-d&#251;m before records resume, in the eighteenth century of the Third Age.  The first King listed there, the penultimate King in Khazad-d&#251;m, was Durin VI, so it follows that there must have been a Durin II, III, IV and V among the many unknown Kings (indeed we have some records of Durin III, who received a Ring of Power from Celebrimbor himself).It was Durin VI who had the misfortune to rule Khazad-d&#251;m at the time its miners discovered and released a sleeping menace deep among their mithril veins.  This was the Balrog that came to be known as Durin's Bane, a creature much too powerful for the Dwarves to control.  Durin was killed soon after its appearance, and succeeded by his son, N&#225;in I. N&#225;in's rule was a short one - he too was killed within a year of his father's death, and his subjects fled their ancient home.According to legend, N&#225;in I was not the last King of Khazad-d&#251;m.  Some sources suggest that his distant descendant, Durin VII, came back to the kingdom of his ancestor, and reclaimed it as its King, though this tale cannot be verified beyond doubt.

	A title primarily given to the Vala Ulmo, whose special province was the oceans, seas and waters of the Earth.  Ulmo not only ruled the Sea, he also dwelt in its depths1, and so lived apart from the other Valar.The title 'King of the Sea' also appears in Akallab&#234;th, but there it is given not to Ulmo, but to Ar-Pharaz&#244;n, the last King of N&#250;menor, as he sails on Middle-earth to defeat Sauron.
	Notes
	1
	Specifically, Ulmo's Halls seem to have been located beneath Ekkaia, the Encircling Sea, to the west of Valinor.  At least, this is the conception in the original Lost Tales.

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Established on 1 May III 3019
	Race:
	Men
	Division:
	D&#250;nedain
	Title&nbsp;of:
	Aragorn Elessar, and presumably also his heirs
	A title taken by Aragorn Elessar on his accession to the throne of Gondor, signifying his Kingship over all the Free Peoples of the West, from the north to the south.In both the North- and South-kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain, there had been no King for many centuries.  At the time of Aragorn's coronation, there had been no King of Gondor for 969 years, and no King of a united Arnor for 2,158 years.  The last King to rule both realms jointly had been Aragorn's distant ancestor Isildur, though his Kingship was cut short at the the Disaster of the Gladden Fields before he could truly take up the rule of his twin realms.From that time, when the Third Age was just two years old, the West had had no uniting King.  At the coronation of Aragorn, two years from the Age's end, Arnor and Gondor were at last united once again, and Aragorn's rule of the West is therefore referred to as the Reunited Kingdom.

Ladros
	[ladros.txt]
	The northeastern reaches of Dorthonion
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age
	Location:
	To the northeast of Dorthonion
	Pronunciation:
	la'dros
	Meaning:
	Probably something close to 'plain of dew'1
	A highland region to the northeast of Dorthonion.  It was held briefly as a fief by the House of B&#235;or, but lost to Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach.The region of Ladros seems originally to have been a fief of Finrod Felagund (at least, his brothers Angrod and Aegnor held 'the northern slopes of Dorthonion', according to Quenta Silmarillion 14, Of Beleriand and its Realms).  Finrod later assigned this land to Boromir of the House of B&#235;or, whose members had long been loyal in his service2.Of the House of B&#235;or, there were three lords of Ladros - Boromir himself, his son Bregor, and Bregor's son Bregolas.  In Bregolas' time, Morgoth overwhelmed Dorthonion and Ladros in the Dagor Bragollach, in which Bregolas himself was slain.  His brother Barahir and twelve faithful men, including his son Beren, became outlaws in their own land, assaulting Morgoth's forces from their hidden lair at Tarn Aeluin on Ladros' southern borders.  They were betrayed by Gorlim the Unhappy, and all were slain but Beren, who escaped into the south.  After this time, Ladros fell under the yoke of Morgoth until it was swallowed by the Great Sea at the end of the First Age.
	In the Narn i H&#238;n H&#250;rin (published by Christopher Tolkien in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth), T&#250;rin Turambar is given the title 'heir of Dor-l&#243;min and Ladros'.  This seems inconsistent with the published Silmarillion: T&#250;rin was descended from the House of Hador, not that of B&#235;or.  Perhaps this birthright came from his mother, Morwen, who was the granddaughter of Barahir's brother Bregolas.
	Notes
	1
	The element -ros is obscure in this context; it might have the meaning 'dew', or it might indicate fine rain or drizzle.
	2
	The date of Finrod's grant of Ladros to Boromir is nowhere recorded, but it must have been in about the year I 400.

Last Alliance of Elves and Men
	[lastalliance.txt]
	The mighty alliance between Gil-galad and Elendil
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	II 3430 to II 3441 (eleven years)
	Races:
	Elves and Men1
	The alliance of Gil-galad of the Elves and Elendil the  Exile of N&#250;menor at the end of the Second Age, whose forces marched on Mordor, besieged Barad-d&#251;r, and defeated Sauron.
	Notes
	1
	The entire alliance that marched on Mordor seems to have consisted of more the merely Elves and Men.  There is a record of at least some of the Dwarves of Durin's Folk fighting with the Alliance, and indeed Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, in its description of the Alliance and its enemies at the Battle of Dagorlad, tells us: 'All living things were divided that day, and some of every kind, even beasts and birds, were found in either host, save the Elves only.'  (Taken literally, this would seem to mean that Gil-galad and Elendil even had Orcs at their command, though that is unlikely to be Tolkien's intention!) Despite this, it is clear that the Alliance was primarily one between the races of Elves and of Men.

	Actually, The Silmarillion never specifically states where the Last Battle will take place, though there is one hint. Akallab&#234;th tells us that Ar-Pharaz&#244;n and his warriors are imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten 'until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom.'  The fact that the Caves are located in Aman strongly suggests that the battle would have to take place there.  This is apparently confirmed by several references in The History of Middle-earth that place the Last Battle in Valinor itself.

Last Bridge

	The Bridge of Mitheithel

	Other entries that link to this page:
	&nbsp;&#149; River Mitheithel
	The old stone bridge that carried the East-West Road over the River Mitheithel, about a hundred miles east of Weathertop.  Its three arches crossed the wide river at the bottom of a valley, and to the east the land rose again into the wooded hills of the Trollshaws, in which Bilbo and his companions encountered an unfriendly trio of trolls.  Indeed, there is an oblique reference to an 'ancient stone bridge' in chapter 2 of The Hobbit that seems to be a reference to the Last Bridge.
	No record of its builders survives, but it was most likely constructed by the D&#250;nedain of Arnor, or perhaps of the later kingdom of Rhudaur, in which it lay.  There was no other means of crossing the river for hundreds of miles to the north, and so the Bridge had great strategic value.  In the War of the Ring, three Black Riders attempted to hold it against Aragorn and the hobbits on their journey to Rivendell.  Their plan was foiled by Glorfindel, who drove them away and left his token, a green beryl, on the Bridge.

	Release from Bondage
	&quot;'I will tell you the tale of Tin&#250;viel,' said Strider, 'in brief - for it is a long tale of which the end is not known...'&quot;
	The Fellowship of the Ring II 4, A Knife in the Dark
	The long Elvish lay that told the story of Beren and L&#250;thien, their Quest for the Silmaril, and their return from Mandos.  It was said to be the second longest of all such tales (with the longest being the Narn i H&#238;n H&#250;rin, the story of T&#250;rin and Nienor).
	The Lay tells the story of Beren's escape from Dorthonion after the loss of his father Barahir.  Coming into the south, he entered Doriath and came across L&#250;thien Tin&#250;viel in the woods.  They desired to wed, but L&#250;thien's father Thingol set an impossible bride-price on his daughter - a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth in the deepest pits of Angband.  Beren set out on his hopeless quest with the aid of Finrod Felagund, but they were captured and imprisoned by Sauron.  L&#250;thien came to their aid through many troubles of her own, and with the help of Huan the Hound she rescued Beren.  Using her magical arts, they penetrated Angband and stole one of the Silmarils, but in their escape Beren's hand, holding the Silmaril, was bitten from his wrist by the great wolf Carcharoth.  Eventually, the wolf was hunted and slain, and the Silmaril recovered, but only at the cost of Beren's life.  Then L&#250;thien, too, passed away, and pleaded before Mandos himself.  Both Beren and L&#250;thien were returned to life, and they dwelt in the south of Ossiriand for a time.  L&#250;thien had become mortal herself, and she passed away at last with her beloved beyond the Circles of the World.
	The Lay is not a mere literary invention - it does substantially exist, and is contained within volume III of The History of Middle-earth, appropriately named The Lays of Beleriand.  When Aragorn told the tale to the hobbits in The Lord of the Rings, he hinted that the end of the lay had been lost in the mists of history.  In fact, though it runs to more than four thousand lines, the lay's lack of an ending was due to the fact that Tolkien never fully completed the poem.

It played little part in history, though it was remembered by the Men of Rohan.  When the Dunlendings invaded Rohan in III 2758, they were aided by Gondor's enemies from the south.  These sea-going marauders landed at Lefnui's mouth on their mission to overrun and destroy the Rohirrim, though they would eventually be defeated.

	Son of Thranduil, Lord of the Elves of Mirkwood.  He set out from Rivendell with the Company of the Ring, and journeyed with Aragorn and Gimli through the southern lands of Middle-earth during the War of the Ring; he fought at the Battles of the Hornburg and the Pelennor Fields.
	Notes
	1
	At least, Legolas seems to refer to himself as a Silvan Elf: in Eregion, he says '...the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk...' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 3, The Ring Goes South).  This is confusing, because his father Thranduil is elsewhere identified as one of the Sindar.  Tolkien touches on this question in his Letters, where he describes Legolas as '...a Woodland Elf, though one of royal and originally Sindarin line.' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 297, dated 1967, our italics).  The explanation for this is found in the History of Galadriel and Celeborn (in Unfinished Tales), where there's a brief account of the arrival of Thranduil's father Oropher among the Silvan Elves of Greenwood the Great.  It's made obvious there that Oropher and his small band of Sindar merged themselves completely with the Silvan people of the Wood, leaving behind their Sindarin inheritance.  That's why Oropher's grandson Legolas thinks of himself as a Silvan Elf, rather than one of the Sindar.

	The last surviving lands west of the Blue Mountains
	Timeline:

	Founded II 11
	Location:
	The far west of Middle-earth, on the shores of the Great Sea
	Race:
	Elves
	Divisions:
	Various2
	Pronunciation:
	lee'ndon
	Meaning:
	'(Land) of Music'3
	The green land to the west of the Blue Mountains; the only region to survive the destruction of Beleriand during the War of Wrath.  Gil-galad, last High King of the Noldor, dwelt there during the Second Age.
	Notes
	1
	There is strong evidence that the name 'Lindon' was applied to this region during the First Age, though 'Ossiriand' was the much more common name in those days.  It only emerged as a 'political' entity at the beginning of the Second Age, though, hence the entry in the Tale of Years for the year 1 of the Second Age: 'Foundation of the Grey Havens, and of Lindon.' (The Lord of the Rings Appendix B, The Second Age).
	2
	During the first half-millennium or more of the Second Age, Lindon was the most important Elvish nation in Middle-earth.  Most, and probably all, the Elven survivors of Beleriand dwelt there for at least some of this period, making for a rich cultural mix.  We know that this included Noldorin exiles (especially from Gondolin, but also from the Houses of Fingolfin and F&#235;anor), Sindar from Doriath and from the Falas, and almost certainly representatives of the Laiquendi, the Green-elves who had occupied Lindon during the First Age.
	3
	This name comes from the singing of the Laiquendi, the inhabitants of the land during the First Age.

	&nbsp;&#149; Bree-landers
	A term for the small race of people more commonly known as Hobbits, especially used by the taller Men (who were in turn referred to as the Big Folk).The origins of the Little Folk are mysterious.  They were evidently an ancient branch of the human race, but they developed in the mysterious east of Middle-earth, and how they came by their small stature and peculiar habits is unknown.  By the time they entered history, in the year 1050 of the Third Age, they had already broken into three distinct groups, the Harfoots, the Fallohides and the Stoors.Over the next two thousand years, the Little Folk spread slowly across the Western lands.  By III 1601, they had acquired a land for themselves, that they called the Shire.  Despite many hardships, the Shire would survive until the time of the War of the Ring and beyond.  Though their land did not survive to our own time, Tolkien's words in the Prologue to The Lord of the Ring suggest that the Little Folk themselves are not extinct, but continue a secret, hidden existence alongside us, the bumbling Big Folk.

Loeg Ningloron
	[loegningloron.txt]
	The resting-place of the Ring
	The region where the Gladden River flowed down from the Misty Mountains to meet the Great River Anduin, south of the Carrock.  In ancient times, a lake had formed at their meeting-place, but by the beginning of the Third Age the lake had gone, to be replaced by a land of marshes and islets.  These were the Gladden Fields (named from the giant yellow iris flowers that grew there in hosts).  In Elvish, the Gladden River was known as S&#238;r Ninglor, from which derived the Elvish name for the Fields: Loeg Ningloron.
	In the first years of the Third Age, after the first defeat of Sauron, Isildur was marching close to the Loeg Ningloron when he was set upon by a host of Orcs.  His soldiers were overwhelmed, and he escaped into the wetlands only to be shot down by an Orc-arrow.  There he was lost, and with him the One Ring that he was carrying north, which lay hidden in the marshes of Loeg Ningloron for nearly two and a half thousand years.

The valley's sheltered aspect, and the relatively warm climate of the Southfarthing, made the region around Longbottom ideal for growing this new plant, pipe-weed, which rapidly became the centre of a thriving industry.  Longbottom Leaf remained one of the most famous varieties of the weed.

The first Leaf-grower was Tobold Hornblower, and his family continued the tradition.  When Merry and Pippin found barrels of Longbottom Leaf in the ruins of Isengard, they bore the brand-marks of the Hornblower family.

Long-worms
	[longworms.txt]
	Scatha and his kind
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Very uncertain, but known to have existed after about III 22001
	Race:
	Dragons
	A type of dragon found in the northern parts of Middle-earth, and perhaps elsewhere. The most famous long-worm (and in fact the only one that Tolkien explicitly identifies) was Scatha of the Ered Mithrin, who preyed on the Dwarves and Men of the Grey Mountains, and was slain by Fram of the &#201;oth&#233;od.Though Tolkien gives almost no clues about long-worms in the text of The Lord of the Rings, his illustrations of dragons give us some further hints.  Tolkien's dragons tend to be sinuous, serpentine creatures, having the appearance almost of a winged snake rather than the more traditional dragon-form.  This would explain the term 'long-worm' easily.  It's interesting to note that Tolkien gave this form to another northern dragon, Smaug, which strongly suggests that he, too, was one of the long-worms.
	It should be noted that Tolkien doesn't conclusively refer to long-worms as a 'type' of dragon, and it is just possible that 'long-worm' is simply another word for 'dragon'.  This doesn't seem very likely, though: if all worms are long, why call them 'long-worms'? Of course, if we assume that long-worms are a 'subspecies' of dragon, there must be other, less long, types.
	Notes
	1
	Fram slew the long-worm Scatha in about the year 2200 of the Third Age, and Tolkien tells us that 'the land [of the &#201;oth&#233;od] had peace from the long-worms afterwards' (The Lord of the Rings Appendix A II The House of Eorl).  This is a little ambiguous - we've taken it to imply that the long-worms continued to exist, but the &#201;oth&#233;od were free from them.  An alternative reading would be that Scatha was the last of the long-worms, and Fram's people had peace because that race of dragons was extinct.  It seems unlikely that Tolkien wouldn't be more definite about such an important fact, though.As for the long-worms' origins, we've assumed on the timeline that they dated back to the First Age, as did dragons as a whole.  In fact, there is no direct textual evidence of their existence before the Third Age, but it is hard to explain their origins if not in the pits of Angband.

This seems to be a point on which Tolkien changed his mind: the title 'Lord of Eregion' only appeared with the revised edition of The Lord of the Rings.

There is also a single case where Denethor's father Ecthelion II is named 'Lord of Gondor', but the title is not otherwise used.  This might, just possibly, imply that 'Lord of Gondor' was a device used only by the later Stewards.  More probably, though, the title was used of all the Stewards, and perhaps the Kings who preceded them, but we have no direct evidence of this usage.

Lord of Moria

	&quot;The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.  Say 'friend' and enter.&quot;
	Alternative translation of the inscription on the West-gate of MoriaThe Fellowship of the Ring II 4, A Journey in the Dark
	A title for the Kings of Durin's Folk, rulers of Khazad-d&#251;m through its long history, who were descended from its ancient founder, Durin the Deathless.  In Elvish, the title was Aran Moria, and the original Dwarvish form was Uzbad Khazadd&#251;mu.  Though the title is used to refer to the historical Kings, it is most prominently associated with Balin, who reclaimed Khazad-d&#251;m for a brief time between III 2989 and III 2994.
	Ennyn Durin Aran Moria
	These four words are transcribed from the Elvish inscription on the West-gate, as illustrated in The Lord of the Rings.  Their meaning breaks down like this:
	Ennyn
	'Doors' or 'Gates', the plural of the word annon, seen for example in Morannon, the Black Gate of Mordor.
	Durin
	A reference to Durin III of Khazad-d&#251;m, who ruled at the time the doors were made.
	Aran
	'Lord' or 'King'.
	Moria
	An Elvish name for Khazad-d&#251;m, derived from mor i&#226;, meaning 'Black Chasm'.
	So, the whole phrase translates into the English as 'Doors of Durin Lord of Moria'.  It turns out that this is a curious anachronism, because in principle the names Durin and Moria should both have been completely unknown to Celebrimbor, the Elf who wrote the inscription.
	The Question of Moria
	The use of Moria here is probably the most widely recognised inconsistency.  The problem is that Moria was apparently the name used for Khazad-d&#251;m after the Balrog was awoken and the Dwarves driven out of their city, when the the deserted darkness was called 'the Black Chasm'.  The Doors and their inscription, though, were made several thousand years before this, when the halls of Khazad-d&#251;m were still populous and full of light.  On that basis, we'd expect Celebrimbor to have used the earlier Elvish name for Khazad-d&#251;m, which was Hadhodrond.
	From a certain point of view, it can be argued that this isn't necessarily as inconsistent as it appears.  Considered alone, The Lord of the Rings nowhere states when the term Moria came into use, and indeed there is even a passage in Appendix F II suggesting that name Moria indicates no more than an underground dwelling-place, without being connected to any particular historical event.  If the Elves used the name in a general sense like this, then it might date back to the time the Doors were made, so that there is no contradiction.  However, The Silmarillion flatly denies this possibility, stating that Khazad-d&#251;m was '...afterwards in the days of its darkness called Moria...' (Quenta Silmarillion 10; our emphasis).
	Given the inconclusive comments in The Lord of the Rings on the one hand, and definite statement in The Silmarillion on the other, it's probably fair to consider the name Moria as being out of place.  This would seem to be Christopher Tolkien's view, too: in the index of The Silmarillion, he defines Moria as the '...later name for Khazad-d&#251;m (Hadhodrond)' (our emphasis).
	The Question of Durin
	If the status of Moria is at least open to question, no such doubt exists over Durin - there is simply no way that Celebrimbor could have known that name.  It comes from Old Norse, a language that didn't even exist when Celebrimbor wrote the inscription above the Doors.  Like most of the Dwarf-names in his work, Tolkien took Durin's name from real Norse legends, so that it merely represents the Dwarf's earlier 'real' name (which is in fact never recorded).  The same problem arises with Balin's tomb inscription (as Tolkien explicitly recognised), whose runes include 'Balin', even though he wouldn't be given that name until thousands of years after the tomb was made.
	A Possible Solution
	It's hard to find an explanation for these curiosities.  One common suggestion is that the problem is merely one of translation, so that the Elvish characters above the Doors contained the true names, with the inconsistencies being introduced in the transcription.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case: the Elf-letters above the Doors, as shown in The Lord of the Rings, spell out 'Ennyn Durin Aran Moria' just as the transliterated versions do (which is a pity, because otherwise we could read Durin's original name there).
	Another tempting explanation, for Moria at least, would be mistake on Frodo's part (Frodo's diary must have been the original source of the illustration).  He was much more familiar with the name Moria than Khazad-d&#251;m or Hadhodrond, so the possibility arises that he simply misremembered the actual name when he later drew the doorway in his diary.  Unfortunately, this idea can't be correct: when he first sees the characters above the Doors, he states 'I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot read these.' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 4).  If he couldn't understand the script over the archway, he couldn't have mistakenly inserted a name in the same script.
	Another possible internally consistent solution might lie in the history of the documents behind The Lord of the Rings (in the story's own terms, the Red Book of Westmarch and its copies).  Indeed, the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings refers to '...much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages...' being made to the book in Minas Tirith.  If this process continued throughout its history we might imagine copyists and scribes adapting the illustration over the centuries, perhaps by mistake, or perhaps to make it easier to understand.  After all, if the inscription was 'Doors of Somebody1 Lord of Hadhodrond', though it might be more accurate, it would make little sense to a casual reader.
	Notes
	1
	What Durin's 'real' name (the name he used publicly, that is) was is a complete mystery.  A literal translation of Durin into Sindarin (the most likely language for his 'outer' name) would be something like Annontirn ('door-watcher'), but whether Tolkien had anything like this in mind for the character is extremely doubtful.

Lord of the &#201;oth&#233;od
	[lordoftheeotheod.txt]
	Leader of the ancestors of the Rohirrim
	The &#201;oth&#233;od were a people descended from the Northmen, who had at one time dwelt in the lands south of the Carrock, but who later travelled into the far north, and settled in the regions where the Anduin had its sources.  Of their Lords, the names of only two are recorded: L&#233;od and his son Eorl.  L&#233;od was killed while attempting to tame a wild horse (the horse later named Felar&#243;f), and so Eorl became Lord of the &#201;oth&#233;od at the age of just sixteen. For this reason, he became known to history as Eorl the Young.
	The distant ancestors of the &#201;oth&#233;od had been allies of the people of Gondor, and soon after he became Lord, Eorl received one Borondir, a desperate messenger of Gondor.  Borondir brought messages from Steward Cirion recalling their old alliance, and asking for Eorl's aid against an overwhelming assault.  The young Lord led the Men of the &#201;oth&#233;od to answer the summons, and they defeated Gondor's invaders at the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.  In reward, Cirion granted Eorl's people the land of Calenardhon to dwell in, and they slowly removed from the north to their new home.  Eorl was the last Lord of the &#201;oth&#233;od: after his time, his people became known as the Rohirrim, and his descendants, rather than being Lords of the &#201;oth&#233;od, were known instead as the Kings of Rohan.

	A woodland kingdom of the Silvan Elves on the western banks of the River Anduin; Galadriel and Celeborn came there in the Third Age, and ruled it after the loss of its ancient lord, Amroth.
	Notes
	1
	That is, the people of L&#243;rien were of Silvan origin.  They were ruled in the later Third Age by Galadriel and Celeborn, neither of whom were Silvan Elves.  Galadriel was of the Noldor, and Celeborn, at least according to the published Silmarillion, was of the Sindar.
	2
	This is the literal meaning, almost certainly in reference to the golden Mallorn trees that grew in L&#243;rien.  The form of the name, though, is almost certainly influenced by the older names of the land, and (especially) by L&#243;rien in Valinor, which Galadriel would certainly have known, and probably visited.  This version of the name, though, derives from (o)lor-, 'dream' rather than (g)lor- 'gold', and this connection with dreams is also sometimes made regarding L&#243;rien in Middle-earth.

	Titles:

	ThingolMelianL&#218;THIENBerenDiorNimloth
	The only daughter of King Thingol of Doriath and Melian the Maia, and said to be the fairest Elf to have ever lived.  She was discovered by Beren as he wandered the woods of her father's kingdom, and they grew to love one another.  When L&#250;thien took Beren before her father, he was apalled that his royal daughter should wish to wed a mortal, and so set Beren what he thought was an unachievable task, to recover a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth himself.  So Beren left Doriath in pursuit of his hopeless quest.After a time, a darkness fell on L&#250;thien's heart, and she learned from her mother Melian what this meant; Beren had been captured by Sauron, and was held in the dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.  Though Thingol sought to stop her, L&#250;thien set out from Doriath to rescue Beren, if she could.  Passing through many adventures, she gained the help of Huan the Hound, and together they came to Sauron's Isle.  Through L&#250;thien's magic and Huan's strength they defeated Sauron and rescued Beren.  Eventually Beren set out for Angband once again, and L&#250;thien accompanied him.Through L&#250;thien's powers, they passed the gates of Angband, and the great wolf Carcharoth that guarded them.  Coming before the Dark Throne itself, she wove a spell that put Morgoth and his court into a deep sleep, and Beren cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown. Returning to the gates, they found that Carcharoth barred their escape.  Beren held up the hallowed Jewel to protect them, but the monstrous wolf bit off his hand, and with it consumed the Silmaril.  But the Silmarils were blessed by Varda herself, so that any unclean flesh that touched them would be withered and burnt.  The wolf's innards were consumed with that burning, and it ran howling into the south.L&#250;thien healed Beren, and they came at last back to her father's halls at Menegroth.  There they heard tidings that the maddened wolf had entered Thingol's realm, and Beren set out with the King to the Hunting of the Wolf.  After nightfall they returned; the wolf was slain and the Silmaril recovered, but Beren was wounded mortally.  So he passed away, and soon after L&#250;thien too wasted of grief.Their spirits were gathered in the Halls of Mandos in the Uttermost West of the World, and there L&#250;thien sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of Mandos himself.  So she was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to Middle-earth with Beren, where they dwelt for a time in happiness on the green island of Tol Galen in the River Adurant.

Fingon succeeded in rescuing him, but he lost his right hand in their escape.With his brothers, Maedhros held the eastern passes into Beleriand; he himself dwelt in a fortress on the hill of Himring.  He worked to unite the Houses of the Noldor, and formed the Union of Maedhros, but that Union perished in the disaster of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.After the defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath, Maedhros and his brother Maglor stole the two remaining Silmarils from the camp of the Valar, but the hallowed Jewels would not suffer the brothers to hold them.  In torment, Maedhros cast himself into a fissure in the earth.

	F&#235;anorNerdanelMaedhrosMAGLORCelegormCaranthirCurufinAmrodAmras
	The second son of F&#235;anor, who inherited more of his mother Nerdanel's gentle spirit than any of his brothers.  Maglor was famed as a poet and bard, but he took the Oath of F&#235;anor in Tirion and shared in the woes that came of it.Maglor followed his father into exile, and saw him perish at the hands of the Balrogs.  With the rest of his brothers, he dwelt to the east of Beleriand, and Maglor settled between the Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, the two rivers that came together to form the long Gelion itself.  That region - which came to be known as Maglor's Gap - lacked hills or mountains, and so was the place on Beleriand's border that was most open to attack from the north.Maglor guarded his Gap for four and a half centuries, but was eventually overcome in the Dagor Bragollach.  The dragon Glaurung invaded Maglor's land and ruined it, so that he was forced to flee to the fortress of his brother Maedhros on the hill of Himring to the west.  Sixteen years later, he marched out with Maedhros to the great battle that should have seen the revenge of the Elves on Morgoth, but was brought to ruin by the treachery of Uldor the Accursed.  Maglor slew Uldor himself, but the field was lost; that was the battle afterwards called the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Unnumbered Tears.All seven of F&#235;anor's sons survived the Nirnaeth.  In the years leading up to that battle, one of the three Silmarils had been recovered from Morgoth's crown, and had come eventually to be held by Dior in Doriath.  He would not surrender it to the brothers' claims, and so they assaulted Thingol's ancient kingdom. Celegorm, Caranthir and Curufin all fell in that futile battle.  Now only four of F&#235;anor's sons survived; Maglor, the eldest son Maedhros, and the two youngest brothers Amrod and Amras.  After some years had passed, these four came to learn that a Silmaril was held by Elwing at the Mouths of Sirion, and though they restrained themselves for some time, their Oath compelled them to take back the Jewel.  So they assaulted their fellow Elves, and Elwing escaped with the Silmaril across the Sea to her husband E&#228;rendil, and together they sailed into the West.  That voyage would in time bring about the downfall of Morgoth.After the destruction of Morgoth, the last two Silmarils were recovered from his Crown.  By this time, only Maedhros and Maglor remained of F&#235;anor's sons, and Maglor came close to repenting the Oath.  Wearily, he accompanied his brother in the theft of the Silmarils, but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the holy Jewels burned their skin. Maedhros in despair leapt into a fiery fissure, and Maglor, the last of the Sons of F&#235;anor to survive, cast his Silmaril into the Sea.  Legend says that he still wanders the shores of the World, singing laments for his despair and regret.
	Notes

	All we know for sure about Maglor's fate is from the closing lines of The Silmarillion, where we're told only that '...he came never back among the people of the Elves' (24, Of the Voyage of E&#228;rendil and the War of Wrath).

	Of the many spirits that descended into Arda at its beginning, those of lesser stature than the Valar, though they were still powerful, were known as Maiar.  Each of the Maiar was attached to the 'people' of a particular Vala. So, for example, the Maia Oss&#235;, as a spirit of the sea, belonged to the people of Ulmo, while Curumo, the Maia who came to Middle-earth as Saruman, belonged to the people of Aul&#235; the Smith.In the Third Age, there were still Maiar in physical form to be found in Middle-earth.  The most important of these were Saruman, Sauron (originally also of Aul&#235;'s people), and Ol&#243;rin, known as Gandalf, who belonged to the people of Manw&#235; and Varda.

Malbeth the Seer

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Flourished III 1864 to at least III 19641
	Race:
	Men
	Division:
	D&#250;nedain2
	Culture:

	Meaning:
	Almost certainly 'golden tongue'3
	Titles:
	The Seer
	A wise Man who lived in the last years of the realm of Arthedain.  Gifted with foresight, he predicted events of the near and far future.  He saw that Arvedui would be Arthedain's last King, and predicted Aragorn's passage of the Paths of the Dead, though it lay a thousand years in his own future.
	Notes
	1
	The dates of Malbeth's birth and death are unknown.  He first enters history during the reign of King Araval, where we find him present at the birth of the King's grandson, Arvedui.  This took place in the year III 1864, at least according to The Peoples of Middle-earth.  Malbeth is a trusted advisor to the royal house at this point - it was he who suggested Arvedui's name to his father Araphant - so it seems likely he was born some decades earlier.In The Return of the King III 5, Aragorn quotes Malbeth's prediction about his own future, and says that this was made '...in the days of Arvedui, last king at Fornost.'  This seems to mean that Malbeth made the prediction during Arvedui's Kingship, which began in III 1964, exactly one hundred years after his birth. Whether Malbeth survived much beyond this point is unknown.
	2
	Actually, there is no specific evidence to state that Malbeth was descended from the N&#250;men&#243;reans, but he seems to have lived for about 150 years or more, which makes this a safe deduction.
	3
	Malbeth's name was perhaps inspired by a real historical figure, St John Chrysostom, who was Patriarch of Constantinople during the late fourth century CE.   His surname Chrysostom means 'golden-mouthed'.

	&nbsp;&#149; Celepharn
	The son of Beleg and grandson of Amlaith of Fornost, the founder of Arthedain.  He became King of that realm at the age of 134, and ruled during troubled times.  It was during Mallor's reign, or perhaps during the last years of his father Beleg, that the Istari - the Wizards - arrived in the north of Middle-earth. They came soon after the shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, and it was near the end of Mallor's rule that they discovered its source at Dol Guldur.  At this time, though, even the Wise did not suspect that it might be Sauron returned.The meaning of Mallor's name isn't known with certainty, but it seems to contain elements relating to gold.  We might speculate, then, that Mallor was one of the wealthier Kings of Arthedain. Apart from the growing menace of Mirkwood, his reign was free of warfare or strife.Mallor ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Celepharn.

	Malvegil son of Celebrindor is best known for the fact that the Witch-king founded the realm of Angmar during his reign.  Nearly seven hundred years after its foundation, Angmar and its allies would destroy his kingdom of Arthedain, but in Malvegil's time there is no record of any open warfare between the two nations.Nonetheless, the emergence of Angmar saw evil things multiply in the eastern lands, driving a westward migration across Eriador.  Notable among those travelling out of the east were the Hobbits, and it was during Malvegil's time as King that the main Hobbit settlement in Bree took place.Malvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-seven years, and was succeeded by his son, Argeleb I.

	In the old north of Middle-earth lived a proud race of wild horses, long-lived, wise and fleet of foot.  The legends of Men said that their ancestors had been brought from the West by B&#233;ma, their name for the Vala Orom&#235;.One of these was captured as a foal by L&#233;od of the &#201;oth&#233;od.  It grew into a strong white horse, but when L&#233;od tried to mount it, it threw him and killed him. L&#233;od's son Eorl took the horse himself, naming him Felar&#243;f.  Felar&#243;f was one of the greatest horses to have ever lived, and was said to understand the speech of Men.  He carried Eorl when the &#201;oth&#233;od rode south to Rohan, and there sired a race of horses nearly as great as himself.These were the Mearas, noble horses that lived as long as a Man, and had extraordinary strength and intelligence.  Throughout their history, they would only allow themselves to be ridden by the Lord of the Mark or his sons.  This long tradition was broken by Gandalf, who managed to train the greatest of the Mearas of his time, Shadowfax, and rode that mighty horse throughout the War of the Ring.The word Mearas comes from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning simply 'horses'.  Its singular form would be mearh, but no character in The Lord of the Rings ever uses that word.

There, in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she came upon Elw&#235; Singollo (Elu Thingol) as he marched into the West with the people of the Teleri.  Many of his people remained in Beleriand searching for their lord (these were to become the Sindar), but through the enchantment of Melian, he remained hidden from them.At last, Melian and Thingol came forth from Nan Elmoth and founded the kingdom of Doriath, which Melian protected from the hosts of Morgoth through her powers.  She encircled the land in the Girdle of Melian, which none could pass without her wishing it.Melian and Thingol ruled in Doriath for many centuries, but when at last Thingol was slain by treacherous Dwarves, Melian departed from the halls of Menegroth and returned across the Great Sea to Valinor.

They removed to Valinor, and fearing for the coming Elves, made war on Melkor and imprisoned him for three ages.  By the time he was released, the Elves had come to Valinor; Melkor turned back to his evil ways; slaying Finw&#235; and stealing the Silmarils, he destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor and fled back to his ancient fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.

	Meneldil's farewell to Isildur, his only recorded wordsUnfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth 3 I The Disaster of the Gladden Fields
	An&#225;rion(three unnamed siblings2)MENELDILCemendur
	The son of An&#225;rion and grandson of Elendil, the first King of Gondor to rule in his own name.  He was succeededby his son Cemendur.Meneldil's Early LifeOf Meneldil's life before the War of the Last Alliance we know almost nothing, but it is possible to deduce some of the most important incidents in that time.  He was born in the very last years of N&#250;menor, and was at most twenty years old at the time of the Downfall.  He would have seen the drowning of the island with his own eyes, from the deck of one of his father's ships, and then was propelled by the rushing water to the shores of Middle-earth.What part he took in the building of the Realms in Exile is a mystery.  During this time, he would have been considereda relatively minor nobleman.  As the fourth child of Elendil's younger son, he was at best seventh in line to the succession, and the prospect of his becoming King was remote.  After more than a century, Sauron rose again in the east, triggering the great events of the War of the Last Alliance.  It is to be presumed that Meneldil played his part in that War - a war in which he lost his father An&#225;rion - but we have no specific details of his deeds.The Year of Transition, III 1 - III 2Before the War, Elendil had sat as the High King in the northern realm of Arnor, while Isildur and An&#225;rion had ruled Gondor jointly in his name.  Since both Elendil and An&#225;rion had been lost in the War, these arrangements needed to be changed.  Isildur inherited the High Kingship, and he placed the rule of Gondor in the hands of his brother's eldest eligible son, Meneldil3.Before departing for the North, Isildur spent a year ordering matters in the Gondor, and instructing Meneldil in his new duties.  During this year, Isildur and Meneldil journeyed around the borderlands of the South-kingdom, defining its bounds.  It was while returning from their travels that they came upon Amon Anwar, the Halifirien,which at that time stood almost at the central point of the country.  Isildur chose that hill as the resting place of his father's remains, and the Tomb of Elendil that he placed there was to last long after Meneldil's line had failed.It was the beginning of Yavanni&#235;4 when Isildur set out from Osgiliath, leaving the South-kingdom in Meneldil's hands.  We are told that Meneldil was notdisappointed to see the High King and his sons leave for the North, and that he hoped to rule Gondor himself for a long time.  Far-sighted as he was, though, even Meneldil couldn't haveforeseen the events that were to unfold.  A month after setting out, Isildur was set upon by Orcs and killed, together with his three elder sons.  The Kingship in the North fell on Isildur's only surviving son, eleven-year-old Valandil.  This unexpected turn of events transformed Meneldil from a mere caretaker into the true King of Gondor.The Rule of Gondor, III 2 - III 158After the upheavals of III 2, Meneldil was to rule Gondor for many years,but during this period he effectively disappears from history.  With Sauron utterly defeated, his reign was a peaceful andquiet one.  The only historical events recorded during this time are the wedding of Elrond to Celebr&#237;an, and the birth of their twin sons Elladan and Elrohir.  These would have been important events in the North, but we cannot be sure if the Gondorians were even aware of them.Meneldil ruled in Gondor for one hundred and fifty-six years, and was succeeded by his son Cemendur.
	Historical RepercussionsThe unlikely ascension of Meneldil to Gondor's throne had a vast impact on history.  It resulted in the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor becoming politically separate entities, with Arnor ruled by the descendants of Isildur, while Gondor's Kingship was inherited by the descendants of Meneldil.  It is far from certain that this was Isildur's intention, or even that Meneldil had any legal claim to the throne at all.As Isildur left Osgiliath on a fine day in III 2, he seems to have meant to maintain the system founded by his father Elendil.  The High King would reign in the North-kingdom of Arnor (hence that country's name: 'Land of the King'), while the South-kingdom of Gondor would be a dependent state, ruled by a lord appointed by the King.  That system broke down almost immediately when Isildur and his three elder heirs were lost, leaving Arnor without a King for seven years (until Isildur's youngest son Valandil reached his majority).When Valandil became King of Arnor, he should legally have inherited the Kingship of Gondor too, and we might have expected Meneldil to acknowledge the authority of the new High King.  Meneldil did no such thing.  He seems to have taken advantage of Valandil's youth and inexperience to establish himself as a King in his own right, effectively 'declaring independence', and removing Gondor from Arnor's control.  This could even be seen as Meneldil's usurping the throne of Gondor, and it is surprising that there is no record of any dissent at the time.Nearly two thousand years later, Arvedui used just this argument as part of his claim on the throne of Gondor.  Arvedui was the King of Arthedain and a direct descendant of Isildur, while Gondor had recently lost its own King, Ondoher, and both his heirs.  The Council of Gondor rejected Arvedui's claim on the grounds that Isildur had 'relinquished' - actually given up - the rule of Gondor to Meneldil.  This does not seem to be historically correct, and it could be said that Arvedui had rather a strong claim on Gondor's throne.We know that Meneldil was a shrewd and intelligent man, and it seems more than plausible that he simply invented this story of Isildur's 'relinquishing' Gondor to his rule.  It certainly isn't true, since we have evidence that Meneldil fully expected Isildur to return to the South (in The Disaster of the Gladden Fields, we are told of Meneldil's hope that '...affairs in the North would keep them [Isildur and his sons] long occupied.')  He would hardly have thought in these terms if he truly imagined that his uncle had given him the Kingship of Gondor in perpetuity.Attitudes in Gondor seemed to change in the millennium following Arvedui's claim.  After the War of the Ring, Aragorn claimed the Kingship of Gondor under the same terms as Arvedui, and the people accepted him as High King, the first to rule both Arnor and Gondor since Isildur himself.
	Notes
	1
	The date of Meneldil's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable, especially since an alternative birth date of II 3318 also appears in that source.  According to that alternative version of events, Meneldil was the last Man to be born in N&#250;menor before it was destroyed the following year, but this story seems to have been abandoned.  Later drafts apparently supersede this, instead naming Isildur's eldest son (there called 'Kiryandil', but later renamed Elendur) as the last N&#250;men&#243;rean, and making Meneldil's birth nineteen years earlier: II 3299.
	2
	In an added note that appears in The Peoples of Middle-earth, Meneldil is identified as An&#225;rion's '4th child', but we have no information of any kind regarding his three elder siblings.  Most likely, all three were daughters, or brothers who perished in the War of the Last Alliance (as indeed had An&#225;rion himself).  We do know that Meneldil was a rather ambitious Man, and was eager to take on the rule of the South-kingdom.  If Meneldil was originally fourth in line to the throne, then the disappearance of his elder siblings, combined with his known ambitious character, might even lead us to suspect dark deeds in Gondor's earliest history!
	3
	It isn't entirely clear why Isildur didn't follow his father's example, and commit the rule of the South-kingdom to his own sons.  All four had survived the War of the Last Alliance, and three (Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon) were on hand to take over the task immediately.  Perhaps the fact that Meneldil was elder than any of these (he was probably 143 at the time) swayed Isildur's choice.

	&quot;...and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt.  The Elves all burst into song.&quot;
	From The Fellowship of the Ring I 3Three is Company
	Menelvagor with his shining belt.  The brilliant red star that marks the Swordsman's shoulder is known as Borgil.
	Menelvagor, the Swordsman of the Sky, was the name given by the Elves of Middle-earth to the bright and prominent star-group that we know today as Orion.The stars of Menelvagor were originally given their shape in the sky by Varda, who in Middle-earth has the name Elbereth, 'Star-lady'.  In an ancient time when Melkor still lurked in Utumno, she used the stars to fill the sky with symbols of watchfulness and guardianship.  Together with the Valacirca1, Menelvagor was one of the two most important of these.&#145;The Elves all burst into song.&#146;To the Elves, this constellation had huge symbolic importance, representing an eternal guardian of the World.  In the oldest tradition, The Lost Tales, Menelvagor is the enemy of the exiled Melkor, protecting Arda from his return.  In later developments of the story, the stars came to represent none other than T&#250;rin Turamabar2, who was fated to return from the dead and face Melkor in the Last Battle.  This tradition can be seen in the words of the Silmarillion, where Menelvagor (there called Menelmacar) 'forebodes the Last Battle that shall be at the end of days.' (3 Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor).This perhaps helps to explain the Elves' name for the red star, Menelvagor's brightest, that we call Betelgeuse.  They called it Borgil, which can be translated as 'ever-star3'.
	Reading the Star ClockMenelvagor's appearance in The Lord of the Rings gives us an extra glimpse of detail that might easily be missed: he acts as an immense and spectacular 'clock' that lets us time the action exactly.  The action in question is Frodo's encounter with Gildor and the Elves, as he leaves the Shire on his fateful journey.We know from The Tale of Years that this encounter took place on the night of 24 Halimath, which equates on our calendar to 15 September. We also know that Menelvagor had just 'climbed over the rim of the world'.  For any given date, a constellation will always rise at the same time each year: if we do the appropriate calculations, we discover that the Elves started singing at about ten past one in the morning4.
	Notes
	1
	'The Sickle of the Valar': the stars of Ursa Major that we know today as the Plough or Big Dipper.
	2
	If Menelvagor represents T&#250;rin, then his sword represents Gurthang, T&#250;rin's famous black weapon.  Bearing this in mind, perhaps it is significant that the iron used to forge Gurthang itself came from the sky as a meteorite - the sword's original name was Anglachel, meaning 'Iron of the Flaming Star'.
	3
	The Elvish root bor- has a variety of related meanings: 'ever', 'faithful', 'steadfast', 'enduring'.  These all have a clear relation to the Menelvagor myths.  The translation as 'ever-star' is not arbitrary, though: there is textual evidence of Tolkien's having used bor- elsewhere as the equivalent of 'ever-'.
	4
	For those with a technical turn of mind, this is calculated from the point at which the southernmost star of the body of Menelvagor (Kappa Orionis or Saiph) crosses the eastern horizon in the early morning of 16 September each year.  This turns out to be 01:07, Greenwich Mean Time (which we're treating as equivalent to 'Shire Mean Time' for the purposes of this diversion!).

	&nbsp;&#149; Thistlewool Family
	In the hard years of the Second Age, a race of Men inhabited the White Mountains far to the south of the Shire, in the land that would one day become Rohan.  Groups of these mountaineers began to migrate northwards.  Some settled in the region that became Dunland, but others travelled farther still, and coming to a tall wooded hill not far from the ancient Barrow-downs, they founded a settlement that took its name from the hill, Bree.In appearance, these Men had brown hair, and in stature were short and broad.  They seem to have maintained a curious tradition of taking their names from plants and herbs, and many of these surnames are recorded; Appledore, Ferny, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Rushlight and Thistlewool.  Butterbur was another of these plant-names, an important one in Bree, for it was the ancestral name of the keepers of the Prancing Pony inn.Though Bree seems to have been founded before the beginning of the Third Age, it lay on the road between the North- and South-kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain, and so was drawn into the history of that Age.  When the North-kingdom of Arnor was founded, Bree lay within its borders, and the Men of Bree became subjects of that country. More than a thousand years later, in about III 1300, members of a strange and little-known race began to appear in the township.  Man-like in appearance, but much smaller, these were Hobbits fleeing the encroaching darkness to the east.  Many of them stayed among the Men, and a unique society arose where the Big People and the Little People lived beside one another in harmony.

	Principal lands and regions of the northwest ofMiddle-earth at the time of the War of the Ring
	The great continent on which much of the Silmarillion, and the adventures of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, are set.  Little is known of the East and South of Middle-earth, or of the far north, but the geography and history of its Western lands are chronicled in great detail.Ancient TimesThe foundations of Middle-earth were laid by Aul&#235; in times ancient beyond reckoning, and the Valar lit the new lands with two great Lamps, Illuin in the north and Ormal in the south. From fear of Tulkas, Melkor had fled beyond the Walls of the World, and Middle-earth was a place of peace and beauty.  The Valar themselves dwelt in its central regions, on the green island of Almaren.  This was the time known as the Spring of Arda.Unknown to the Valar, though, Melkor secretly returned, and delved his first great fortress of Utumno in the mountains of the far distant north.  When he judged the time was right, he assailed Almaren and, surprising the Valar, destroyed their habitation in Middle-earth.  Fleeing back to Utumno, he saved himself from the wrath of Tulkas. This is one of the great disasters of Middle-earth's history: the Valar departed forever, and left Middle-earth under the sole control of Melkor, who claimed it as his own.Though the Valar made a new home for themselves in Aman, and lit their new land of Valinor with the light of the Two Trees, Middle-earth was now left in darkness for many Ages. The Valar did not completely forget their ancient home, though, and Yavanna and Orom&#235;, especially, came there from time to time to try and mend the hurts of Melkor if they could.It was at this time, too, that Aul&#235; returned, and secretly fashioned a hall beneath the mountains of Middle-earth4.  It was there that he wrought the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, who were given life by Il&#250;vatar, and set to sleep until the awakening of the Firstborn.Despite these brief visits from the Valar, though, Middle-earth was effectively controlled by Melkor, who was free to act as he would.  Slowly, his polluted realm spread southwards over Middle-earth.The Coming of the ElvesThe Awakening of the Elves at Cuivi&#233;nen brought about profound changes in Middle-earth. At first they lived in darkness, prey to the creatures of Melkor, but Orom&#235; found them, and the Valar decided to act: they went to war against Melkor.There followed the Battle of the Powers, in the north and west of Middle-earth. That war rent and twisted the lands, giving them the shape they were to keep until the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.  Dorthonion and the highlands north of Beleriand were raised up at that time, and many bays, including the Bay of Balar, were created.Melkor was ultimately defeated, and taken as a prisoner back to Valinor.  After much debate, the Valar also offered the Elves a home in Aman, and many accepted.  Led by Orom&#235;, the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri made the Great Journey across Middle-earth from the far east where they awoke to its western shores.Many of these departed Middle-earth across the Sea, but some remained, of which the major groups were the Sindar of Beleriand and the Nandor of the Anduin valley.  Other groups, mainly of Telerin origin, had also left the Journey: these were the people who were to become known as the Silvan Elves.  Also, in the far east, remained the Elves who had refused the summons of the Valar, the Avari.  All these kinds together are known as the Moriquendi, the Dark Elves, for they did not go to Valinor or see the light of the Two Trees.
	Notes
	1
	Middle-earth is conventionally treated as a single continent, but in fact may have consisted of more than one landmass.  Tolkien's writings on this topic, and especially his Letters, suggest that Middle-earth is defined as that part of the world inhabited by mortal beings (that is, all the lands of Arda except Aman and, apparently, the Empty Lands).  It might therefore easily have consisted of more than one continent.
	2
	The Silmarillion specifically states that Aul&#235; was individually responsible for making Middle-earth: he &quot;wrought two mighty lamps for the lighting of the Middle-earth which he had built amid the encircling seas&quot;. (The Silmarillion, 1 Of the Beginning of Days).
	3
	This interpretation is supported by Tolkien in his letters, and also by the quote above (note 2). In fact, the name is from an Old English word: Middangeard (probably more familiar in the form Midgard - see The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No. 165).
	4
	We are given no clue as to where this hall might have been.  It's tempting to imagine a connection with Khazad-d&#251;m, and this would certainly help to explain the 'sign' that Durin saw in the lake of Kheled-z&#226;ram, but Tolkien doesn't hint at any such connection.

	&nbsp;&#149; Regent of Gondor
	&nbsp;&#149; R&#243;mendacil II
	&nbsp;&#149; Tarostar
	Hyarmendacil I was a mighty King, and his reign during the ninth and tenth centuries of the Third Age saw Gondor grow into a huge and powerful kingdom, stretching east to the Sea of Rh&#251;n, and south to Umbar.  Hyarmendacil's immediate descendants were not so vigorous.  His son Atanatar, and grandsons Narmacil and Calmacil, were content to live a life of ease in the splendour of Gondor's royal courts.Fortunately, Hyarmendacil's great-grandson Minalcar inherited more of his forefather's strength of mind.  Born in the last years of Hyarmendacil's long reign, Minalcar became active in matters political and military, to the extent that, not long after his uncle Narmacil became King, he handed effective control of the South-kingdom to his nephew.  Minalcar took up the challenge, and managed to rebuild some of the power that Gondor had lost in the reigns of his grandfather Atanatar and uncle Narmacil.  In particular, Gondor's eastern borders had become victim to Easterling incursions.  Minalcar built a great army and wiped out the invaders from the lands west of the Sea of Rh&#251;n.It was from this event that he took the name R&#243;mendacil 'Victor in the East'.  After Narmacil's heirless death, and a brief reign by his own father Calmacil, Minalcar finally ascended the throne to take up the true Kingship of Gondor, to be known to history by the name R&#243;mendacil II.

	The son of Hyarmendacil II1 of Gondor, King Minardil had two sons, Telemnar and Minastan.  He had reigned for just thirteen years when he was attacked at Pelargir by the Corsairs of Umbar, and slain.  He was succeeded by Telemnar, who himself died with all his children in the Dark Plague just two years later.  Ultimately, the throne was taken by Tarondor, the son of Minardil's second son Minastan.  Minardil is perhaps best known as being served by Steward H&#250;rin of Emyn Arnen, the ancestor of the later Ruling Stewards.
	Notes
	1
	In fact, The Lord of the Rings gives contradictory accounts of the parentage of Minardil.  In Appendix A, the king-lists show his father as Hyarmendacil II, but later in the same Appendix he's described as 'Minardil, son of Eldacar'.  In fact, Eldacar had died 131 years before Minardil took the throne, and the text should surely read 'Minardil, great-grandson of Eldacar' (just as his assailants Angamait&#235; and Sangahyando were the great-grandsons of Eldacar's usurper, Castamir).

	The high white tower of King Ingw&#235; of the Vanyar, rising above the houses and halls of Tirion, the great city of the High Elves in Aman.  In the courts below the Mindon (the tower is often simply referred to as 'the Mindon') grew the silver-white tree Galathilion.  Far above the courts, high in the Tower, a silver lantern was housed, whose light shone far across the Sea and along the dim shores beneath the Pel&#243;ri.
	It was beneath the Tower that F&#235;anor gathered the Noldor after the Darkening of Valinor, and there he swore the Oath of F&#235;anor with his sons.  From the courts, the Noldor marched after F&#235;anor into exile, and it is said that their last sight of the fair lands of Aman was the shining beacon of the Mindon Eldali&#233;va.  Having left its light far behind, the Noldor were given the terrifying Doom of Mandos, laying a curse on them if they continued their journey into exile.  F&#235;anor and his followers marched on, but Finarfin gave up the journey there, and led many of his people back into the south, where they were greeted once again by the high lantern of the Tower.

Min-Rimmon

	Beacon-hill of Gondor
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	A beacon was built on Min-Rimmon sometime before III 25101
	Location:
	In An&#243;rien, about half-way between the Firien Wood to the west and the Dr&#250;adan Forest to the east
	Meaning:
	Questionable2
	Note:
	This beacon's name also appears in the forms 'Min-rimmon' and 'Minrimmon'.
	One of the seven beacon-hills of Gondor, on the northern flanks of the White Mountains. With Eilenach and Amon D&#238;n, Min-Rimmon was one of the oldest beacons, set in place even before the foundation of Rohan.
	Notes
	1
	There is only one piece of definite evidence that bears on the foundation of Min-Rimmon's beacon, in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth.  There (I 2 (iii) Cirion and Eorl, to be precise) we are told that the three oldest beacons (Amon D&#238;n, Eilenach and Min-Rimmon) were built to communicate with the northern defenders of Gondor before the foundation of Rohan in III 2510.  The suggestion there is that the first beacons were constructed because of the loss of the palant&#237;ri, which took place between III 1437 (when the Stone of Osgiliath was lost during the Kin-strife) and III 2002 (with the loss of Minas Ithil to the Nazg&#251;l, and with it the Ithil-stone).  Orthanc's palant&#237;r also fell out of use during this period, probably with Gondor's abandonment of Orthanc in (probably) the seventeenth century of the Third Age. Min-Rimmon's beacon, then, was likely put in place during the latter half of the second millennium of the Third Age.
	2
	The meaning of 'Min-Rimmon' is not known.  If it is Elvish, Min- can mean 'tall, prominent' (as in minas, 'tower'), but it can also means 'one, single' (as in minya, 'first').  Rimmon is stated to be an ancient name of unknown origin, and this might perhaps also apply to the prefix Min-.

	Most precious of metals

	Meaning:
	Approximately 'mist-glitter'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Moria-silver, Truesilver
	Also called 'truesilver', and many other names besides; the remarkable metal that the Dwarves discovered in the mines of Khazad-d&#251;m.  It was supple and easy to work, and could be polished to shimmer like silver that never tarnished, and it was as strong as steel.  In Middle-earth, mithril was found nowhere but the Dwarf-mines of Khazad-d&#251;m, though there are indications that it was also found in N&#250;menor and in Aman.The metal held a value almost beyond price.  In N&#250;menor, King Tar-Telemmait&#235; became so greedy for mithril that it gave him his name - Telemmait&#235; means 'silverhand'.  In Middle-earth, meanwhile, the Dwarves' discovery of mithril drew the Noldor to found the kingdom of Eregion in the lands west of their mines.  As the years passed, the seams beneath Khazad-d&#251;m began to be worked out, and the Dwarves dug deeper and deeper.  It was their deep mining for mithril that would awake the Balrog, Durin's Bane, and bring about the downfall of their kingdom.Of all the mithril artefacts, the most famous is surely the coat of mail given to Bilbo Baggins by Thorin Oakenshield, that was held for a while in the Michel Delving mathom-house before being worn by Frodo during the Quest of Mount Doom. Many other of the World's most important items were made of mithril, too.  The symbol of High Kingship worn by Elendil and Isildur was the Elendilmir, a diamond bound to the brow by a mithril fillet, and Nenya, one of the Three Rings of the Elves, was also made of the metal, again bearing a diamond.  Greatest of all, according to legend, was the ship of E&#228;rendil in which he sailed into the sky, making the gleam of truesilver visible to the world as the Evening and Morning Star.
	Notes
	1
	The name mithril comes from two Elvish roots, mith (probably 'mist' in this context) and ril ('glitter').  Mith has the secondary meaning of 'grey', but since we know that mithril not only had a silvery sheen, but was also fabulously light, it is surely the meaning 'mist' that is intended.

	Quenta Silmarillion 11Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor
	The First Rising of the Moon
	After the Darkening of Valinor and the destruction of the Two Trees, Telperion the White Tree bore one last Flower of Silver before its end.  Aul&#235; and his people made a vessel to carry to the silver flower aloft, and Tilion, one of the hunters of Orom&#235; was granted the task of steering the new Moon through the sky.  Tilion guided his charge up into the western skies just as the Noldor were returning into Middle-earth, and so marked the beginning the First Age.  The Moon first rose above Valinor in the far West of the World, but Varda came to change this arrangement, so that the Moon would pass beneath the World, and arise in the east instead, as it does to this day.
	According to the legends of the Elves, Tilion was an unsteady steersman, sometimes dwelling overlong beneath the Earth, or appearing in the sky at the same time as the Sun.  He was drawn to the bright new Sun, launched from Valinor shortly after his own vessel, and his coming too close to his fiery companion was said to account for the darkening of the Moon's face.
	The Moon remained important to the inhabitants of Middle-earth and N&#250;menor throughout their long history.  This is perhaps most evident in Elendil's famous son Isildur, whose name means 'Servant of the Moon'.  In Middle-earth, he dwelt in Ithilien ('Moon-land') in a tower he named Minas Ithil ('Tower of the Moon').  Though that tower was later captured by the creatures of Sauron, and renamed by Men as Minas Morgul, the symbol of the Moon remained powerful there.  Even at the end of the Third Age, its inhabitants still used the Moon as their emblem, though they corrupted that sign with a face of death.
	The hobbits had their own tales about the Moon as well, singing songs about a jolly but unpredictable being they named the Man in the Moon.  This peculiar figure seems to be an echo of the being described in the Elves' stories, the Maia and hunter Tilion, wayward steersman of the Moon.

Some moon-letters could be read by any moonlight, but it was possible to make the writing even more secret.  More sophisticated moon-letters could only be read by the same shape of moon, or at the same time of year, as when they were written.
	Moon-letters were written with silver pens.  The substance ithildin, made from mithril, reflected only starlight and moonlight, and it seems likely that ithildin, or something very similar, was used by the Dwarves to write their moon-letters.

	[morannon.txt]
	The Black Gate
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Originally built during the Second Age1Also known to have existed in III 30192
	Location:
	Crossing the Haunted Pass of Cirith Gorgor
	Origins:
	Built by Sauron
	Pronunciation:
	mora'nnon
	Meaning:
	'Black Gate'
	Other&nbsp;names:
	Black Gate, Black Gates, Gate of Mordor, Gates of Mordor
	The Black Gate that Sauron built across the entrance of the valley of Ud&#251;n, the only opening in the mountainous defences of his Black Land of Mordor.
	Notes
	1
	There is no historical record before the end of the Second Age that mentions the Morannon specifically, so it isn't possible to state precisely how long it had existed.  However, there is a reference in Akallab&#234;th that tells us that Sauron '...had fortified the land of Mordor and had built there the Tower of Barad-d&#251;r...' between about II 1000 and II 1600.  It seems reasonable to consider the Morannon as part of this fortification, which would mean that it stood for most of the Second Age, as shown in the timeline above.  At the very least, we know it was in place by the end of that Age, because it is mentioned in accounts of the War of the Last Alliance.
	2
	It is not known what happened to the Morannon during the Third Age.  It may have been destroyed after the War of the Last Alliance, or incorporated by the Gondorians into their own defence of Mordor.  Whether Sauron needed to rebuild it or not, it was certainly in place and under his control at the time of the War of the Ring.

	The Black Land
	After the destruction of the strongholds of evil in the north of Middle-earth at the end of the First Age, Sauron fled southwards seeking new lands.  At the end of the first millennium of the Second Age, he chose a land walled by mountains, and there built his great fortress of Barad-d&#251;r.  After Sauron settled there, the land became known as Mordor (the Black Land) - no record of an earlier name for this region exists.After the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance, Mordor was taken under the control of Gondor, and the Gondorians built fortifications around it to prevent the return of evil things; the greatest of these was Minas Ithil (later Minas Morgul).  As Gondor's power faded, however, Mordor once again fell into the hands of the Enemy, and after two thousand years of relative peace, the Nazg&#251;l returned and claimed the land once again in the name of Sauron. Sauron himself, however, dwelt at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and did not himself return openly to Barad-d&#251;r until some seventy years before the War of the Ring.In that War, Sauron's power was finally defeated when the One Ring was cast into the Cracks of Doom, and the land of Mordor once again came under the control of the South-kingdom.The Geography of MordorMordor was a land of approximately rectangular shape, measuring some 600 miles east to west and 400 north to south. On all but its eastern borders, where it marched with Rh&#251;n and Khand, it was surrounded by the mountains of the Ered Lithui and the Ephel D&#250;ath.Offshoots of its mountain fences divided the land into two distinct regions, the barren uplands of Gorgoroth in the northwest, and the more fertile southern plain of Nurn, where the inland sea of N&#250;rnen lay.In the far northwest of Mordor, where the mountains of the Ered Lithui and Ephel D&#250;ath came together, lay a valley named Ud&#251;n (after the ancient fortress of Melkor in the north of the World).  This was the only break in Mordor's western mountain-defences, and Sauron built a great gate, the Morannon, at its mouth to protect his realm.The History of Mordorc. II 1000 to II 3262Mordor is not mentioned in the histories of Middle-earth before the end of the first millennium of the Second Age1, when Sauron chose it as his dwelling place.  While its natural defences must have influenced his decision, we are told that the main reason for his choice was Orodruin, the great volcano that lay in the central regions of the Plateau of Gorgoroth, and which Sauron used in his sorcery, including the forging of the One Ring.Through the rest of the Second Age, Mordor became a base for Sauron's struggle for power in Middle-earth.  Though he had many successes in this struggle, at one time controlling all of Eriador, he also suffered many setbacks at the hands of the Elves and, especially, the N&#250;men&#243;reans.His worst reverse came in 3262 (Second Age) when Ar-Pharaz&#244;n, the last King of N&#250;menor, landed in Middle-earth with an unstoppable army.  Sauron's forces fled, and he offered himself as hostage to Ar-Pharaz&#244;n, leaving Mordor and travelling with the victorious N&#250;men&#243;reans back to their island home.We are told little of Mordor after Sauron left it - his armies having fled, it must have been an empty, barren place for a time.  Eventually, though, some part of his followers seem to have returned. After the destruction of N&#250;menor and the founding of Gondor by Elendil and his sons, one of their first works was the building of Minas Ithil at the feet of the Ephel D&#250;ath 'as a threat to Mordor'2, which suggests that even with Sauron absent, the remaining inhabitants of the Black Land posed a threat of their own.II 3320 to II 3441Sauron himself secretly returned to the Black Land after the Downfall of N&#250;menor, and the Gondorians were apparently unaware of this for a time.  Soon, though, Orodruin burst into life once more, and the Men of Gondor understood that the Dark Lord had returned to Barad-d&#251;r.After more than a century, in 3429, Sauron had rebuilt his armies sufficiently to contemplate an assault on the newly founded kingdom of Gondor on his western borders.  He attacked and took Minas Ithil, but Isildur (who dwelt there at that time), escaped and fled north to his father in Arnor.Sauron's stroke was mistimed, for he was not yet strong enough to capture Osgiliath, Gondor's capital, and this gave Elendil the time to forge a military alliance with his friend Gil-galad, the last High King of the Noldor.  Elendil and Gil-galad marched with the host of this Last Alliance to the gates of Mordor, where they worsted Sauron in a mighty battle on the plain afterwards called the Dagorlad.  There followed the seven-year Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, but the forces of the Last Alliance eventually captured and destroyed the Dark Tower, and consigned Sauron to the shadows.III 1 to c. III 1980Through some two thousand years of the Third Age, Mordor was a deserted and empty land, under the control of the Gondorians (although none of that people dwelt there).  As time passed, though, and the power and might of Gondor dwindled, the watch on the borders of Mordor was relaxed.In 1975 (Third Age), the Battle of Fornost was fought in the north, and the forces of Angmar were defeated. The Witch-king of Angmar (the Lord of the Nazg&#251;l) fled into the south and entered Mordor, taking it again in the name of Sauron and gathering the others of his order there. The Gondorian watch on Mordor had not been maintained, and after the Dark Plague some three hundred years earlier, Minas Ithil and the other forts and castles on Mordor's borders stood empty.  This made the Nazg&#251;l's return all the easier.c. III 1980 to III 3019Soon after their return, the Nazg&#251;l attacked Minas Ithil, and took it once again. This was in the year 2000, twenty years after their return, and Minas Ithil withstood a two-year siege before it fell. We know the Tower was unmanned in 1980, so we must assume that the Gondorians had quickly garrisoned the city once they learned of the Nazg&#251;l's return - this makes sense when we consider that the King of Gondor at that time was E&#228;rnil II, who was a great general before he became King.After its capture, Minas Ithil was renamed Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery, and so the ancient dwelling of Isildur became a dark place and a threat to the Gondorians who had built it two thousand years before.For a thousand years, Mordor was to be ruled in Sauron's stead by the Lord of the Nazg&#251;l. Sauron himself was slowly and secretly growing in power at Dol Guldur to the north, and did not wish to reveal himself until he had sufficient strength to face his enemies.By 2941 (Third Age), Sauron had grown sufficiently to face his foes.  The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, but he had prepared for this and abandoned that stronghold, returning to his ancient kingdom of Mordor in the following year.  He rebuilt his capital of Barad-d&#251;r, and began the ordering of Mordor for war.That war, the War of the Ring, was to see his final downfall.  In its closing days, an army of Gondor stood before the Morannon and challenged him, and he sent overwhelming forces to answer their challenge.  Secure in the certainty of his victory, he was unaware that two Hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, had secretly entered Mordor over the Ephel D&#250;ath with the One Ring.  Travelling across Gorgoroth, they reached Orodruin where the Ring was destroyed, bringing Sauron's rule to an end and leaving Mordor once again a desolate land under the control of Gondor.
	Notes
	1
	We take this dating from the Tale of Years.  In the Akallab&#234;th, though, Tolkien writes 'Already in the days of Tar-Minastir, the eleventh King of Numenor,  [Sauron] had fortified the land of Mordor...'.  Tar-Minastir ruled N&#250;menor between II 1731 and II 1869, some eight centuries after the Tale of Years says Sauron installed himself in Mordor, so we take this reference to mean simply 'Mordor was already fortified in the time of Tar-Minastir' rather than 'Mordor was fortified during the time of Tar-Minastir'.

	After his theft of the Silmarils and Darkening of Valinor, Morgoth fled the Valar, and returned to Middle-earth with Ungoliant before the beginning of the First Age.  In his ancient fortress of Angband, far to the north of Beleriand, he made an Iron Crown for himself, with the Silmarils mounted upon it.In the first year of the First Age, the Noldor returned to Middle-earth to make war on Morgoth for the recovery of the Silmarils.

Mouth of Sauron

	The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-d&#251;r
	Dates:
	Extant in III 3019
	Race:
	Men
	Culture:
	Black N&#250;men&#243;reans
	Titles:
	Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-d&#251;r, Messenger of Mordor
	&quot;The rider was robed all in black, and black was his lofty helm...&quot;
	The Return of the King V 10, The Black Gate Opens
	A Man of great power and importance in the land of Mordor, the ambassador of Sauron. He was sent by Sauron to treat with the Captains of the West at the Black Gate of Mordor prior to the last battle of the War of the Ring. Had his master won that war, he would have ruled the defeated western lands from a rebuilt Isengard, in the place of Saruman.  That was not to be, though, and of his fate after the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r nothing is known.
	&#145;I am the Mouth of Sauron&#146;In The Black Gate Opens, the Mouth of Sauron hails the Captains of the West with an introduction: 'I am the Mouth of Sauron'.  This is somewhat problematic,  because earlier in The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn says of Sauron that 'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken...' (The Two Towers III 1, The Departure of Boromir).  The Mouth of Sauron, though, uses the name several times without apparent embarrassment.All the evidence suggests that Aragorn is simply wrong.  Not only does the Mouth of Sauron use his Lord's 'right name' freely, but so does the messenger sent to D&#225;in in Erebor.  Indeed, we hear about D&#225;in's messenger at the Council of Elrond, at which Aragorn was present: he must have been - to use Gandalf's word - 'inattentive' on this point.One possible reason for Aragorn's error is that his information is out of date. For most of the Third Age, Sauron had been building his strength, in secret, at Dol Guldur. Given his need to remain hidden, it's natural that he would ban his servants from using his real name.  Any detailed information that Aragorn had about him and his ways would date back to Gandalf's spying expeditions in this period.The Tale of Years entry for the year III 2951 states 'Sauron declares himself openly...'  At this point, about seventy years before the War of the Ring, Sauron no longer felt any need for secrecy, and so presumably permitted his name to be used from that point on.  Aragorn, of course, would have had no way of knowing about this change, which would explain his mistake.Did Tolkien intend all this?  Probably not - it seems much more likely that Aragorn's words were a casual slip of the author's pen.  The explanation given here, though, does make a certain amount of sense within the context of the story.

This delta formed the Mouths of Entwash.So great was the inrush of Entwash that Anduin could not carry all its water, and so a marshland formed on the Anduin's eastern bank, called Nindalf, or Wetwang in the Westron tongue.

	'N&#225;in' follows the form of the Old Norse dwarf-names like 'Thr&#225;in', but it isn't clear whether Old Norse is actually the source of the name in this case.  It may be relevant that nain is the French word for 'dwarf', a fact that Tolkien must certainly have known. It is isn't clear whether this correspondence is intentional, or merely a bizarre coincidence.

	Notes

	On the subject of these creatures, Gandalf says 'Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he.' (The Two Towers III 5, The White Rider). Sauron is older than the World itself, so this can't be literally true, unless Gandalf means to suggest that the nameless things are Maiar (which seems rather implausible).  Nonetheless, it is clear that these are very ancient creatures indeed.

	Notes
	1
	This is the meaning given by Christopher Tolkien in his index to the Silmarillion, apparently based on the word-root ndan-, meaning 'back'.  Given that the Nandor journeyed away down the Vales of Anduin, it might be tempting to associate their name with the more common nan, 'valley', but this does not seem to be correct.

	The stronghold and realm of Finrod Felagund, founded by him on the model of the halls of Menegroth in Doriath.The stronghold of Nargothrond was carved into the rock beneath Taur-en-Faroth, and could only be approached by a narrow path along the high banks of the River Narog.  No bridge was built across the river until late in its history.  The citadel long lay hidden from Morgoth, and was ruled wisely for long years by Finrod.  After he was lost in the Quest of the Silmaril, his brother Orodreth expelled the usurping sons of F&#235;anor, Celegorm and Curufin, and was lord in Nargothrond.The lands to the north of the citadel were considered part of its realm, and the people of Nargothrond kept unceasing watch on the grasslands to the north, the Talath Dirnen or Guarded Plain.When T&#250;rin dwelt in Nargothrond, he persuaded the Elves who dwelt there to change their long policy of secrecy, and openly attack the servants of Morgoth.  So the Dark Lord discovered the city's location, and sent out an army under Glaurung to sack and destroy it.

	Narmacil I, son of Atanatar II Alcarin, inherited the Kingship of Gondor when the South-kingdom was at the height of its power and wealth.  He was not a great King, and indeed soon tired of the role.  In III 1240, after just fourteen years on the throne, he turned over the rule of Gondor to his nephew Minalcar, who ruled as Regent through the rest of Narmacil's titular Kingship.Narmacil's Regent Minalcar was a powerful and energetic Man, who routed the armies of the Easterlings, fortified the borders of Gondor and actively pursued diplomacy with Gondor's neighbouring tribes.  It is not recorded, though, that his uncle King Narmacil had any hand in any of Minalcar's great endeavours.  Narmacil, in fact, is chiefly remembered as being Gondor's second childless King, the first having been Tarannon Falastur in the tenth century.Narmacil I sat on the throne of Gondor for sixty-eight years, but for fifty-four of these years Minalcar ruled Gondor as Regent.  Narmacil died childless, and was succeeded by his younger brother Calmacil.

	The date of Narmacil's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable.
	2
	The root-word nar literally means 'fire' or 'flame', but it is often used figuratively to refer to the sun, or to the colour red.  So, 'sun sword' or 'red sword' would be reasonable alternative translations.  In any event, it is likely that Narmacil II ultimately took his name from his thirteenth-century ancestor, Narmacil I.

Narsil

	The mighty Sword of Elendil
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Probably forged some time in the First Age1Broken in II 34412
	Origins:
	Forged by Telchar of Nogrod
	Pronunciation:
	na'rseel
	Meaning:
	'fire' and 'white light'3
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Sword of Elendil; after its reforging it was named And&#250;ril
	&quot;...and the sword of Elendil filled Orcs and Men with fear, for it shone with the light of the sun and of the moon, and it was named Narsil.&quot;
	Of the Rings of Power and the Third Agein The Silmarillion
	The Sword of Elendil, forged by Telchar of Nogrod in or before the First Age.  The sword was broken in Elendil's fall at the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r, and its Shards became an heirloom of his heirs throughout the Third Age until it was reforged as And&#250;ril and borne by Aragorn II Elessar in the War of the Ring.
	Notes
	1
	Details of the original forging of Narsil are difficult to determine.  It was made by Telchar of Nogrod, who also made the Dragon-helm of Dor-l&#243;min.  Helpfully, a passage in Unfinished Tales tells us that the Dragon-helm was originally made for Azagh&#226;l of Belegost, who died in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in I 471; in order to make the helm specifically for Azagh&#226;l, Telchar must have been working at about this time.  Though we can't be certain of Narsil's origins, then, we can fairly safely place its forging in Telchar's workshop in Nogrod, probably during the fourth or fifth centuries of the First Age.
	2
	Narsil was broken in the War of the Last Alliance, with the fall of its wielder Elendil.  Its burning light was lost, but Elendil's son Isildur used its broken shards to cut the Ruling Ring from Sauron's finger. The shards were eventually brought to Imladris, and they became an heirloom of the House of Isildur.  During the War of the Ring, the sword was reforged, its light was rekindled, and it was borne by Elendil's distant descendant Aragorn, who renamed it And&#250;ril.
	3
	The origins of Narsil's name are complex, and contain an element of symbolism.  Tolkien himself described the name's derivation in his Letters:'Narsil is a name composed of 2 basic stems without variation or adjuncts: &#8730;NAR 'fire', &amp; &#8730;THIL 'white light'.  It thus symbolised the chief heavenly lights, as enemies of darkness, Sun (Anar) and Moon (in Q) Isil.'(from The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 347, dated 1972)

	Notes
	1
	The -ya ending is normally used to form adjectives, so n&#225;r 'fire' becomes narya 'fiery'.  However, in Aldarion and Erendis (Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth II 2), Tolkien apparently uses -ya as a diminuitive ending, so the alternative meaning 'little fire' is possible.

	&nbsp;&#149; Far Harad
	An indefinite region that lay to the south of Gondor and Mordor, beyond the River Harnen.  Little is said of it in the histories of Middle-earth, except that the Men of that land conspired with those of Khand, and with the Wainriders, to overthrow Gondor in the time of King Ondoher.  The Gondorians anticipated their strike, and Ondoher created a Southern Army to defend his land against them.  That Southern Army, under the command of E&#228;rnil, met the invading Men of Near Harad in South Ithilien, and defeated them completely.
	Though Near Harad is not otherwise described in any detail, its inhabitants were clearly great enemies of the Gondorians, and it seems likely that many of Tolkien's references to the Haradrim, the Men of Harad in general, actually describe those of Near Harad.  This is especially true of their dealings with the sometime Gondorian outpost of Umbar, which lay on the shores of Middle-earth to the west of Near Harad.

	Meaning:
	'Hither Shore'3
	A mountainous coastal land on the northwestern bounds of Beleriand; the dwelling place of Turgon and his people during the first and second centuries of the First Age, before their removal to Gondolin.
	Notes
	1
	Beginning in this year, the people of Turgon began to remove from Nevrast and secretly make their way to the newly built city of Gondolin.  After their passing, Nevrast became an empty land, though the name was still used for the abandoned region.  This entry's timeline shows the period for which Nevrast was an established Noldorin kingdom.
	2
	There were Sindar living in Nevrast during the Years of the Trees before the First Age.  When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, the native Sindar of this region accepted Turgon as their lord, and the two peoples mingled.  Noldor and Sindar alike left their homes in Nevrast when Gondolin was completed.
	3
	According to the published Silmarillion, Nevrast originally described the entire western shoreline of Beleriand, distinguishing it (as the Hither, or near, Shore) from Haerast, the distant shore of Aman. The Etymologies, though, show us that this derivation is a later development.  There, the name Nevrast comes from an older form, Nivros(t), meaning 'wide western valley'. (The History of Middle-earth Volume 5, The Lost Road and Other Writings III The Etymologies).

	Pronunciation:
	nee-e'nna
	Meaning:
	Approximately 'She Who Weeps'
	Eru Il&#250;vatarNIENNAMandos(N&#225;mo)L&#243;rien(Irmo)
	A Queen of the Valar, the sister of N&#225;mo and Irmo, who dwells alone on the western borders of the World.  Nienna ranks as one of the eight Aratar, the most powerful of the Valar.Grief and mourning are Nienna's province; in her halls in the distant west1, she weeps for the suffering of Arda.  Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, and from this grief entered the world in its beginning.She teaches pity and endurance; though she rarely travels to the joyful city of Valmar, she goes more often to the halls of her brother Mandos to comfort and counsel those in the Halls of Waiting.  The Maia Ol&#243;rin, who was later to travel to Middle-earth as Gandalf, learned much from her.Nienna played a part in the making of the Two Trees of Valinor; she wept on the mound of Ezellohar, watering it with her tears.  After the destruction of the Trees by Melkor, she once again wept on their wounded remains, cleansing the filth of Ungoliant, and helping to bring forth the last fruit and flower that were to become the Sun and the Moon.The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spends her time in the world mourning for the destruction he has wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his part.Of Nienna's appearance we have almost no knowledge.  The only hint is in Quenta Silmarillion 9, Of the Flight of the Noldor, where she 'cast back her grey hood'.  Given that Gandalf was her student, this might (though somewhat doubtfully) have some relevance to his title, the Grey.
	Notes
	1
	It is unclear exactly where the house of Nienna was.  References in the Valaquenta to its being 'west of West, upon the borders of the world' and that 'the windows of her house look outward from the walls of the world' suggest that it may not have been in Valinor at all.  Though Aman was certainly in the distant west, it clearly did not mark the end of the world - it had western shores beyond which lay the Encircling Sea.  These references hint, though certainly do not prove, that Nienna's halls may actually have stood on the western Walls of the World, rather than the western shores of Valinor as is usually assumed.

Nori
	[nori.txt]
	One of the twelve Dwarvish companions of Thorin Oakenshield
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Indefinite.  Born before III 28591, and survived at least until III 30182
	Race:
	Dwarves
	Division:
	Durin's Folk
	Culture:
	Dwarves of Erebor
	House:
	House of Durin3
	Meaning:
	An Old Norse name.  The meaning is not certain; one possibility is 'waterman'
	A Dwarf of the House of Durin, who accompanied his lord Thorin II Oakenshield on the Quest of Erebor.
	Notes
	1
	F&#237;li and K&#237;li were known to be the youngest of Thorin's companions.  The elder brother, F&#237;li, was born in III 2859, so Nori must have been born before that date.
	2
	The Council of Elrond was held in this year, and Gl&#243;in reported to the Council that Nori was still dwelling in the halls of Erebor with King D&#225;in Ironfoot at that time.
	3
	Though they did not belong to the royal line, we do know that Nori, together with Dori and Ori, belonged to this most important of Dwarvish houses.  More problematic, though, is the relationship between these three Dwarves.  They seem to have been quite closely related, and it is natural to assume that they were brothers, though Tolkien nowhere states this.  When they arrive at Bag End in the opening pages of The Hobbit, Dori and Nori both wear purple hoods, while Ori's hood is grey.  This may well be an insignificant detail, but it might just hint that Dori and Nori were brothers, with Ori being a cousin or other less close relation.

	The Two Kingdoms founded by Elendil and his sons were originally intended to form two parts of a greater nation of the D&#250;nedain, ruled by a High King at Ann&#250;minas.  This was not to be.  The loss of Elendil's son Isildur in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields led to a chain of events that separated Arnor in the north from Gondor in the south, and the two kingdoms continued to follow different paths through history.Arnor, the North-kingdom of the D&#250;nedain, was ruled by the direct descendants of Isildur, beginning with Valandil, his youngest son.  Though the bloodline of the Northern D&#250;nedain came directly from the old High King, theirs was a troubled realm.   Internal strife and war with Angmar saw Arnor become fractured and eventually destroyed, leaving the D&#250;nedain of the North a dwindled and wandering people.Nonetheless, the line of Isildur was maintained through the Chieftains of this people.  Aragorn II was Isildur's Heir through thirty-nine generations, and it was he who reunited the Kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain after three thousand years of separation.

North Gate

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Built some time after III 23401.  Probably survived the War of the Ring2.
	Location:
	On the East Road, at the northern end of the High Hay
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Bucklanders
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Buckland Gate, Hay Gate
	Note:
	The gate's name can appear as either 'North Gate' or 'North-gate'.  There is no distinction between the two forms.
	A gate built by the Bucklanders to protect their land.  It stood at the northern tip of Buckland, where the High Hay met the East Road, just east of the Brandywine Bridge.
	Notes
	1
	III 2340 is the date of Buckland's foundation, and since the Gate is part of the Hedge built by the Bucklanders, it cannot precede this date.  It seems that the Hedge wasn't erected immediately after the colonisation of Buckland (at least that is the apparent meaning of the words '[The Bucklanders'] land was originally unprotected from the East...').  The only specific dating evidence we have for the Hedge, and therefore the North Gate, is that 'It had been planted many generations ago...' (These quotes are from The Fellowship of the Ring I 5, A Conspiracy Unmasked).
	2
	The last definite mention of the North Gate is on the night of 1 October III 3018, when it was used by the Black Riders to leave Buckland.  Many Shire buildings were destroyed during the following troubles, but it seems likely that the Gate would have survived.

This was the first of two such loops, known as the Undeeps, and was naturally known as the North Undeep.

	General map of N&#250;menor1
	The island kingdom of the D&#250;nedain, raised from the sea by the Valar as a gift and reward to the Men who had remained faithful through the dark years of the First Age.  The Edain who had dwelt in Beleriand were led to the island in II 32 by Elros the Half-elven, who unlike his brother Elrond had chosen to be counted among Men rather than Elves.Elros became the first King of N&#250;menor, taking the name Tar-Minyatur.  Under his rule, and the rule of his descendants, the N&#250;men&#243;reans rose to become the most powerful nation of Men in that or any other age.  Their mighty ships returned to Middle-earth in II 600, and there they founded havens and cities.For the early part of their history, the N&#250;men&#243;reans were closely allied with the Elves of Tol Eress&#235;a, which lay close to their western shores.  The Elves visited them often, and taught them much, but the N&#250;men&#243;reans themselves were forbidden to sail westwards, because the Valar feared they would become envious of the Undying Lands they and the Elves inhabited. As their greatness and power grew, the N&#250;men&#243;reans began to turn against the Ban of the Valar, and at last Ar-Ad&#251;nakh&#244;r, who became King in II 2899 turned openly against it, though he did not dare defy it.The last King of N&#250;menor was Ar-Pharaz&#244;n the Golden, who usurped the throne of the rightful queen M&#237;riel in II 3255. He took his armies to Middle-earth to make war upon Sauron, and so great had the N&#250;men&#243;reans become that Sauron's forces deserted him.  Seeing an opportunity to destroy his enemy, Sauron sued for peace and returned with the King to N&#250;menor. He gradually gained Ar-Pharaz&#244;n's trust, and persuaded him to sail openly against the Valar.  This he did in II 3319, but as he set foot on the forbidden shores of Aman, the Land of Gift was taken away and swallowed beneath the waves forever.Some few survived the Downfall; Elendil, his sons and his followers had prepared themselves for the disaster and taken ship, and were driven back across the seas to Middle-earth. There they founded the famous realms of Arnor and Gondor, though these were but a dim reflection of the glory of N&#250;menor at its height.

	This interpretation is based on Christopher Tolkien's 'Sad Water' as a translation for the (presumably related) name N&#250;rnen, in the index to Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth.

Oakenshield
	[oakenshield.txt]
	The surname of King Thorin II
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	First used in III 2799; Thorin its bearer died in III 2941
	Origins:
	Originated at the Battle of Nanduhirion
	Race:
	Dwarves
	Division:
	Durin's Folk
	Meaning:
	Derived from the Old Norse dwarf-name Eikenskjaldi, from the poem V&#246;lusp&#225;, with the same meaning: 'shield of oak'
	Family:
	House of Durin
	Title&nbsp;of:
	Thorin son Thr&#225;in II, later King Thorin II in his own right
	The title and surname of King Thorin II of Durin's Folk.Thorin acquired the title long before he became King.  When he was just fifty-three (a young age for a Dwarf) he marched with a mighty Dwarf-army to the valley they called Azanulbizar, Nanduhirion beneath the East-gate of Moria.  There they fought the Battle of Nanduhirion, the last and greatest in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.  In that battle, Thorin's shield was broken, so he cut a bough from an oak-tree with his axe, and used that instead to fend off his enemies' blows, or to club them.  It was that oaken branch that gave Thorin his surname, but it did not completely save him from injury - it is recorded that he was wounded in the battle.That is the legend of Thorin's surname within Tolkien's tales, but in fact it comes from a real-world source.  Like many Dwarvish names, it appears in the Norse poem V&#246;lusp&#225; in the form Eikinskjaldi, but there it is the personal name of a Dwarf, not a surname as in Tolkien's work.

Isildur cursed them to survive without rest until their oath was fulfilled.  So they haunted the Paths of the Dead throughout the Third Age, waiting for Isildur's heir to appear and grant them the chance to fulfil their word at last.

	Roughly thirty1 years before the rising of the Sun
	Location:
	The court of the King in the city of Tirion
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Noldor
	&quot;They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il&#250;vatar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not...&quot;
	Quenta Silmarillion 9Of the Flight of the Noldor
	The dreadful irrevocable oath taken by F&#235;anor and his seven sons in the city of Tirion. They swore in the name of Il&#250;vatar that they would not rest until the three Silmarils were in their hands, and to make war on any who withheld them.At the time the Oath was sworn, Morgoth held all three of the Silmarils, having stolen them from F&#235;anor's stronghold at Formenos.  Driven by the unbreakable Oath, F&#235;anor led the greater part of the Noldor out of Aman and back to Middle-earth, in hopeless pursuit of the Dark Lord.  F&#235;anor himself was mortally wounded by Balrogs in the Noldor's first assault.  From that time on, while Morgoth held the three Silmarils in his Iron Crown, the Elves of Beleriand were bound by a common enemy.The true danger of the Oath was revealed after Beren and L&#250;thien recovered one of the three Silmarils from the depths of Angband.  Thereupon, the Sons of F&#235;anor made war upon the other Elves of Beleriand for the recovery of the Jewel.  They attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Doriath, killing Thingol's Heir Dior.  When the Silmaril escaped them there, they discovered that it was held at the Mouths of Sirion by Dior's daughter Elwing; again they attacked, and again the Silmaril escaped them.  Carried out to sea by the power of Ulmo, Elwing brought it to her husband E&#228;rendil the Mariner, and they sailed with it back into the West.That Silmaril was lost to F&#235;anor's sons, but two more remained on Morgoth's Crown.  After the War of Wrath and Morgoth's defeat at the end of the First Age, just two of the original oath-takers survived, F&#235;anor's eldest sons Maedhros and Maglor.  They stole the Silmarils from the camp of the victorious host, but because of the evils they had committed in recovering them, they found that they could no longer touch the holy Jewels without enduring searing pain.  In despair, Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into the depths of the Earth, while Maglor cast his into the deep ocean.  Maglor was the last of the oath-takers, and was said to wander the shores of the world lamenting his pain and loss.
	Notes
	1
	Following the timescales set out in Annals of Aman (in volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth).  Actually, the dating there might in principle place the Oath anything up to fifty years before the appearance of the Moon and Sun, but the arrangement of the text suggests a briefer period of thirty years, or perhaps slightly less.

Ogres
	[ogres.txt]
	A mysterious and fearsome race
	Dates:
	Mentioned just once, in events of III 2941
	Meaning:
	The word 'ogre' first appears as hogre in French fairy-tales - it seems not to have a particular meaning
	Note:
	Though ogres are fleetingly mentioned in the very earliest versions of Tolkien's work, he seems to have later abandoned them.  Given that the only published reference to them is a brief consideration by Bilbo, where he thinks of them only as belonging to tales, it seems reasonable to guess that there were no 'real' ogres, even in Middle-earth.
	Monstrous and destructive creatures of legend and folklore.  In fact, it is doubtful whether Ogres ever existed in Middle-earth.  Tolkien mentions them only once, in The Hobbit, during Bilbo's Riddle-game with Gollum.  In his attempt to solve Gollum's fifth riddle, Bilbo '...sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales...'  Since no ogre is ever again mentioned, it is entirely possible that they were a mythical race even to the inhabitants of Middle-earth.

The Sindarin version of this name, with the same meaning, was Amon Uilos.  There is in fact some confusion over the term Oioloss&#235;.  In most sources, it is simply used as another name for the great mountain Taniquetil, but in Valaquenta, it seems to refer specifically to Taniquetil's uttermost snow-covered peak.  This subtle shift suggests that its meaning may have changed slightly at some time in the name's history.

The evidence points strongly to his being born after Bilbo's visit to his father in III 2941, so his age could be no more than 77 at the time he is called 'The Old'.  He may, of course, have lived longer that this.B&#235;or was the first of Men to encounter the Elves, having led his people across the Blue Mountains into Beleriand.  He was 49 at the time of that meeting, and died after another forty-four years of service to Finrod Felagund, at the age of 93.The oldest of the three, though, was Aldor, the third King of Rohan.  He lived for more than a century, 101 years to be precise, and ruled the land of the Rohirrim for no less than seventy-five years.

	The main route through the great forest originally known as Greenwood the Great and latterly as Mirkwood.  Where the Road crossed the Great River, there was originally a stone bridge, but the later years of the Third Age the bridge had been lost and the river was crossed by the Old Ford.  From there, a traveller following the Road east would cross some miles of open country before plunging into the depths of the forest. The Road then ran directly east from one side of the forest to the other, covering more than two hundred miles beneath the canopy of trees before it emerged by the banks of the River Running.Of the origins of the Road we know little for certain.  We can be sure that it existed before the end of the Second Age, because a record exists of the stone bridge being specially strengthened to carry the armies of the Last Alliance.  A strong clue to its origins is presented in its Sindarin name, Men-i-Naugrim, meaning 'Dwarf-road'.  The Dwarves had a tradition of road-building dating back to before the First Age, and it seems that they must have built the Forest Road to carry traffic between their western and eastern clans.  It's particularly notable that the old bridge over the Anduin at the Road's western end lay almost exactly halfway between the ancient Dwarvish meeting-place at Gundabad to the north, and Durin's mansions of Khazad-d&#251;m to the south.

	The fact that the Road led to the Ford of Bruinen strongly suggests that it was made after the founding of Rivendell in the mid-Second Age.  Its most likely construction date would be the first few centuries of the Third Age, at the time when Eriador was still under the united rule of Arnor, but there is no direct evidence for this.

He was at Bilbo's farewell Birthday Party (he would have been ninety-nine years old at the time) and was the first to suspect the true meaning of Bilbo's disappearance at that Party - that he had set out on another adventure.  Old Rory was succeeded as Master of Buckland by his elder son, Saradoc.

Old Toby
	[oldtoby.txt]
	One of the best varieties of pipe-weed
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Introduced after about III 26701
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Meaning:
	'Old Toby' was the nickname of Tobold Hornblower, who first introduced pipe-weed to the Shire
	One of the most notable varieties of the plant known as pipe-weed or Halflings' Leaf, grown in the region around Longbottom in the Shire's Southfarthing.  It took its name from the famous old Hobbit who introduced pipe-weed to the Shire, the original 'Old Toby', Tobold Hornblower.
	Notes
	1
	The first pipe-weed of any kind was grown in the Shire in about the year 1070 by the Shire-reckoning (that is, the year 2670 of the Third Age), so Old Toby must have appeared after this date.  Its apparent connections with Longbottom (where the first Leaf was grown) and the Hornblower family (who first grew it) hint that it was developed fairly soon after this date.

Oliphaunts

	Apparently became extinct after the end of the Third Age1
	Location:
	Originated in the southern lands of the Harad
	Species:
	Evidently related to modern elephants
	Meaning:
	Ultimately from Old High German olbenta, meaning 'camel'2
	Other&nbsp;names:
	M&#251;makil
	&quot;Oliphaunt am I,Biggest of all,Huge, old, and tall.&quot;
	from Sam's rhyme of the oliphauntin The Two Towers IV 3, The Black Gate is Closed
	A word for the southern monsters also known as M&#251;makil, evidently gigantic cousins of the modern elephant.  Oliphaunt is a real word from ancient English.
	Notes
	1
	The last documented oliphaunts were seen in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on 15 March III 3019.  We have to assume that they died out some time after that battle, because (as far as we know) they no longer exist anywhere in the world.
	2
	It should be emphasised that this derivation from the Germanic word for camel is Tolkien's own theory, and is not supported by all etymologists.  Others link the word to the Greek elephantos (meaning both 'ivory' and 'elephant').  While Tolkien acknowledged this connection, he thought olbenta to be a more likely direct ancestor of oliphaunt, which is just one of many variant spellings of the word going back into history.  Tolkien's choice of this word was perhaps influenced by the character of Sir Olifaunt, a giant knight who appears in Chaucer's 'Sir Thopas' among the Canterbury Tales.

	Location:
	Southern Mirkwood and the borders of Mordor
	Origins:
	Bred by Sauron
	Race:
	Trolls
	Pronunciation:
	o'log-high
	Meaning:
	'Troll-people'
	A race of trolls bred by Sauron in the later years of the Third Age, seen among the trees of southern Mirkwood, and the mountain borders of Mordor.  They were superior to other trolls in almost every way: stronger and more powerful, but also showing greater intelligence and skill.  Many of their abilities they owed to being under the direct will of their master, Sauron, and while under his control they could exist in direct sunlight, unlike others of their kind.
	In the battle before the Gates of Mordor, Aragorn and the Captains of the West encountered a company of large trolls, identified as 'hill-trolls out of Gorgoroth'1.  That battle took place in sunlight, and so it seems to follow that the hill-trolls must have been Olog-hai.  They are described as being taller than a man, and covered in horny scales, carrying hammers and bucklers in their claws, though there is no way of knowing whether this description applies to all of the Olog-hai, or just to those in the battle.

	'Dreams' is really an inadequate translation of olori, but there is nothing in English that comes close to this concept.  To the Elves, memory and imagination presented a mental image that had the clarity of reality - it is to these clear perceptions that the word olori actually refers.

	A title and surname given to Beren son of Barahir, an English translation of Elvish Erchamion.  It derives from his encounter with the great wolf Carcharoth before the gates of Angband.  Beren and L&#250;thien had recovered one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's Crown, and were escaping with the Jewel when Carcharoth barred their way.  Beren held up the holy Jewel in the hope of cowing the wolf, but instead Carcharoth took his right hand, still clasping the Silmaril.  Because it was blessed by Varda herself, the Silmaril seared the innards of the creature of Morgoth, and it fled in agony.  Meanwhile, Beren's wound brought him close to death, but Thorondor and his Eagles plucked Beren and L&#250;thien out of danger and away to safety.  The lost Silmaril would eventually be recovered in the Hunting of the Wolf, but in tales Beren was known ever afterwards as Beren One-hand.

	Notes
	1
	Onod is the Elvish equivalent of the Mannish name Ent, but its etymology is obscure.  The word 'Ent' literally means 'giant', but if onod is intended to be an Elvish translation of this term, Tolkien has left us no evidence.  The Etymologies (in volume 5 of The History of Middle-earth) is usually instructive in these matters, but for Onod it provides little help.  The only possible clue is an Elvish root ono-, related to the idea of parenting, which might connect to the Ents' role as 'Shepherds of the Trees', but it must be admitted that this is a rather tenuous link at best.

	Notes

	Exactly what happened to Orcrist at Thorin's funeral isn't completely clear.  The Hobbit tells us that the sword was placed by Thranduil 'upon his tomb', and that it 'gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached' (The Hobbit 18, The Return Journey).  These quotes seem to suggest that Orcrist wasn't actually buried with Thorin, but instead just laid on his tomb.In The Lord of the Rings, there's a suggestion that this may have changed.  We are told there that Orcrist '...lay now upon the breast of Thorin...' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 3, The Ring Goes South).  This seems to suggest that the sword was actually placed within Thorin's tomb, and not just placed on it, though this text is admittedly ambiguous.

	Derives from Old English, 'demons' (but see The Etymology of 'Orc' below)
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Goblins, Glamhoth, Yrch
	Little is known for certain of the beginnings of the Orcs, the footsoldiers of the Enemy.  It is said that they were in origin corrupted Elves captured by Melkor before the beginning of the First Age. In appearance, Orcs were squat, swarthy creatures.  Most of them preferred the darkness, being blinded by the light of the Sun, but the kinds bred later in the Third Age such as the Uruk-hai could endure the daylight.
	The Etymology of &#145;Orc&#146;'...the word is as far as I am concerned actually derived from Old English orc 'demon', but only because of its phonetic suitability...'The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 144, dated 1953The word orc could be called the Tom Bombadil of Tolkien's etymology; it occurs in different variants in almost all the languages of Middle-earth, but we have almost no details of how they interconnect.  The variety of 'orc'-words is illustrated by Tolkien himself:'Orc is the form of the name that other races had for this foul people as it was in the language of Rohan.  In Sindarin it was orch.  Related, no doubt, was the word uruk in the Black Speech...'The Lord of the RingsAppendix F I The Languages and Peoples of the Third AgeSo it is clear that these words are all related (and orc is also, apparently, used freely by speakers of the Common Tongue). What is harder to discover, though, is how these words are all related to one another.  Why does the rural hobbit-dialect use essentially the same word for these creatures as in the courts of Minas Tirith or Caras Galadhon?  When it comes to the word's origins, there are three possible theories.Theory 1: Ancient Mannish TonguesThe connection of orc to Old English strongly suggests a Mannish origin.  Other old words of this kind, like mathom and smial, have their origins in the ancient tongues of the Northmen (hence the shared understanding between the Hobbits and Rohirrim, whose ancestors had once lived in the same northern regions). This language can be traced back to the ancestors of the Edain in the First Age, from whose language also came the Ad&#251;naic tongue of N&#250;menor and ultimately the Common Speech of Middle-earth.This puts the first pieces of the puzzle into place.  If the word orc is shared by the language of the Rohirrim, the dialect of the Hobbits and the Westron tongue, it must date back at least to these ancient ancestors of Men.  However, orc surely cannot have been invented by these Mannish-speakers.  They came late onto a linguistic scene in which Sindarin was already well established.  At the time the Elves encountered Men, they had been warring with the Orcs for centuries - it is not plausible that they would have abandoned their own word for their foe and replaced it with one from a coarse alien tongue.  The only realistic alternative is that the earliest Men did not invent the word orc for themselves, but adapted it from Elvish orch, and then passed it down to their descendants.  This accounts for Tolkien's qualification '..but only because of its phonetic suitability...' quoted above.Theory 2: Orkish DialectsAn apparently more practical theory might be that the Orcs invented their own name for themselves, and the other races (especially the Elves) adopted this for their own use.  Unfortunately, this doesn't fit with the established facts:'It is said that [the Orcs] had no language of their own, but took what they could of other tongues and perverted it to their own liking...'The Lord of the RingsAppendix F I The Languages and Peoples of the Third AgeThis seems to suggest that the Orcs didn't originally have a name for their own kind, but borrowed it from some other source. This is a strange conclusion to be sure, but it seems the only one discernable from the text.  We would have to presume that this acquired name was then incorporated into Sauron's Black Speech when it was created long after.  If the Orcs didn't invent their own word uruk, then, it must have come from some other source.Theory 3: ElvishThe only remaining plausible theory is that it was the Elves who invented the word, and passed it on to the other races, including the Orcs themselves.  This is borne out by The Etymologies (in volume 5 of The History of Middle-earth), where we find a reference to an Elvish root &#243;rok, from which the various Elvish words for 'goblin' derive.  This seems to be the oldest origin of the word, from which all the others developed.

	A race of Orcs that inhabited the Misty Mountains.  They were of a recognisably different kind to other Orcs, being somewhat larger than most, and well adapted for life in their tunnels beneath the Mountains.  Their most important contribution to history was at the beginning of the Third Age, when they descended from their Mountains to attack Isildur as he rode home from the War of the Last Alliance.  Thus, the Orcs of the Mountains were directly responsible for the loss of the Ruling Ring that Isildur carried.
	Long centuries after that fateful raid, their chieftain Azog slew the Dwarf-king Thr&#243;r, and so triggered the long War of the Dwarves and Orcs.  After that War, most of the Orcs of the Mountains were slain or scattered, but some survived under the leadership of Azog's son Bolg.  They still had a part to play in history: not least because it was the capture of Bilbo Baggins and his companions by a band of these Orcs that led to the finding of the Ring - the same Ring their ancestors had caused to be lost nearly 3,000 years before.

Orodruin
	[orodruin.txt]
	Mount Doom
	Location:
	Northern Mordor
	Pronunciation:
	o'rodruin ('ruin' is pronounced as in English)
	Meaning:
	'Mountain of Red Flame'
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Amon Amarth, The Fiery Mountain, The Fire-mountain, Mount Doom, Mountain of Fire
	The fire-mountain in the northern parts of Mordor, in which Sauron forged the One Ring during the Second Age, and into which the same Ring fell thousands of years later to bring about the Dark Lord's downfall.When Sauron chose the land of Mordor as his dwelling-place in the Second Age, Orodruin was the reason for his choice.  He 'used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging' (from Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age); the most famous result of his forging, and in fact the only one we know of for sure, was the One Ring, made in about the year II 1600. So powerful was the sorcery used in the making of the Ring that it could not be unmade, except by casting it back into the same fire that had forged it.The first opportunity to destroy the Ring came in the last year of the Second Age, at the end of the War of the Last Alliance.  Sauron was defeated in that War, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand.  Elrond and C&#237;rdan counselled him to destroy the Ring then1 (the battle had taken place at the gates of Barad-d&#251;r, and Orodruin was therefore near at hand), but Isildur refused, and claimed the Ring for himself.  So the doom of the Third Age was made.Orodruin was far more than a natural volcano - Sauron seems to have extended his own power into it, and was able to control its fires.  It seems to have lain dormant when Sauron was away from Mordor, and sprung into life when his power grew.  After the Downfall of N&#250;menor, for example, the Exiles in Middle-earth first knew that Sauron had also escaped the Downfall when they saw smoke rising from Orodruin, and an Age later at the Council of Elrond (The Lord of the Rings II 2), Boromir says 'Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom'.
	Notes
	1
	It isn't clear how Elrond or C&#237;rdan could know that throwing the Ring into Orodruin would destroy it - neither of them had had any part in the making of the Rings of Power, and both had refused Sauron's lore when he offered it to them.  At this time, though, both Elrond and C&#237;rdan were themselves Ring-bearers (of the Elven-rings Vilya and Narya), and perhaps these Rings gave them special insight.

He went to the War of the Last Alliance, where he was slain with two-thirds of his army, but his son Thranduil survived and returned to rule his father's woodland kingdom.(This account is from Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth.  It does not sit easily with a statement in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings that Thranduil was one of the Sindar who travelled eastward from Lindon to found forest realms.  These two accounts aren't completely contradictory, but they are awkward to reconcile.)

	We have no date of birth for Oropher, but he does seem to have been among the wave of Sindarin Elves who travelled eastward across Middle-earth before the year II 1000.  He doesn't appear in any of the accounts of the First Age, which suggests (though does not prove) that he was born in the first millennium of the Second Age.

Orthanc

	The unbreachable tower within the Ring of Isengard
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Constructed in the early days of Gondor, quite possibly before the end of the Second Age.  Unlikely to have been called 'Orthanc' before III 2759 (see Note 1 below)
	Location:
	At the source of the River Isen, at the southern end of the Misty Mountains
	Origins:
	Built by the early Gondorians
	Race:
	Built by Men, but latterly occupied by a Wizard
	Meaning:
	Both 'Mount Fang' and 'Cunning Mind'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Mount Fang, Tower of Orthanc
	The mighty tower of unbreakable stone built by the Men of Gondor in the beginning of their realm, set in the Ring of Isengard at the southern feet of the Misty Mountains.  It was latterly held by Saruman.
	Notes
	1
	'Mount Fang' is the Elvish rendition of Orthanc's name, ultimately from the roots orod 'mountain' and anca 'jaws'.  The meaning 'cunning mind' comes from Old English or&#254;anc, representing a word in the lexicon of the Rohirrim.Tolkien himself is noncommittal on the name's origins.  He says (in The Two Towers III 8, The Road to Isengard): '...the name of [Orthanc] had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning...'.  It is possible, though, to speculate further on the beginnings of the name.There are fairly good linguistic grounds for presuming that the 'Rohirric' meaning is the original, since or&#254;anc is a real Old English word (actually a philosophical term, but meaning more or less 'cunning mind'). This name must have been given to the tower by the Rohirrim who lived in the lands around it, and would only make sense after Saruman's arrival (since his must have been the 'cunning mind' to which it referred).  We can therefore fairly safely date the name 'Orthanc' as emerging in Rohan sometime after III 2759, the year Saruman took up residence there.  That the name is also an approximate Elvish translation of 'Mount Fang' seems to be no more than a curious coincidence.The tower itself was much older than the Rohirrim: it had stood for more than 2,500 years before the land of Rohan even existed.  Its builders, the early Gondorians, would almost certainly have given the tower an Elvish name, but that name is no longer known.  The name they chose for the whole complex of Isengard, where Orthanc stood, is recorded: Angrenost, 'the fortress of Angren'.

	The son of Anardil and descendant of An&#225;rion, who ruled Gondor as its seventh King.  Early in his reign, he undertook a great construction work, the rebuilding and expansion of the Minas Anor.  Reconstructing the citadel was a considerable task (some sources suggest that it took as long as ten years), and it seems to be the source of Ostoher's name (which means 'fortress lord').  After the rebuilding, Ostoher took Minas Anor as his summer residence, and this tradition was carried on by his successors.Much later in his reign, Gondor suffered its first serious assault since the defeat of Sauron some five centuries before.  Bands of Wild Men appeared out of the East, threatening Gondor's eastern lands.  By this time, Ostoher was in his old age, nearly 270 years old, and it fell to his heir Tarostar to meet the Easterling threat.  He succeeded in driving back his enemies, but Ostoher died before his son's victory was complete.Ostoher ruled Gondor for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Tarostar, who became known as R&#243;mendacil I.

These were the great Kine of Araw, that were hunted by the Gondorian nobles, and most famously by Vorondil the Hunter, father of Mardil.  Vorondil had a horn from one of these oxen bound with silver, and this hunting-horn became an heirloom of the Stewards of Gondor.  This was the very horn that Boromir bore long years afterwards: it was broken as he fought with the Orcs beneath Amon Hen, a thousand years after Vorondil's time.

	The thirty-first Thain of the Shire was Ferumbras Took III, who was unmarried and left no heir.  As such, the line of descent from the Old Took's third son Isumbras IV came to an end, and the descent moved on to the line of his fourth son, Hildigrim.  So the Thainship fell on Hildigrim's grandson Paladin, who became Thain Paladin II.At some point, it seems that Hildigrim or one of his descendants had moved a little away from the ancestral home of the Tooks at Great Smials.  Paladin was a farmer who worked the lands around Whitwell - a village which, though it appears on no map, is known to have been close to Tuckborough in the western Green Hills.When Lotho Sackville-Baggins attempted his takeover of the Shire, Paladin came into his own.  As the legitimate Thain, he refused to accept Lotho's authority, and when Lotho's ruffians were found in the Tookland, they were hunted and shot.  So the Tookland remained independent while Lotho and later Sharkey took over the running of the rest of the Shire.  A hundred of Paladin's archers marched to the Battle of Bywater and helped to defeat Sharkey's Men, but Paladin himself does not seem to have been at the battle.Paladin was married to Eglantine Banks, and together they had four children.  The eldest three were daughters, Pearl, Pimpernel and Pervinca, but the youngest was a son.  This was the famous Peregrin Took, who travelled with the Fellowship of the Ring, and would inherit Paladin's title to become Thain Peregrin I.

	1
	There were originally seven palant&#237;ri in Middle-earth (there were evidently others in Aman, too).  Three of these were definitely lost or destroyed: those of Ann&#250;minas, Amon S&#251;l and Osgiliath.  The Stone of Elostirion in the Tower Hills was taken back to Aman on the Ring-bearers' White Ship.  The Anor-stone and the Orthanc-stone both survived into the Fourth Age.The fate of the seventh, the Ithil-stone, is not completely certain.  It was in Barad-d&#251;r during the War of the Ring, and was most likely destroyed in the downfall of Sauron.  The substance used to make the palant&#237;ri, though, was exceptionally strong, and there remains a very slight chance that the Ithil-stone also survived into the Fourth Age.

Paths of the Dead
	[pathsofthedead.txt]
	The haunted caverns beneath the Ered Nimrais
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	II 34411 - 8 March2 III 3019
	Location:
	Beneath the White Mountains, from the Dwimorberg in the north to the Morthond Vale in the south
	Origins:
	Occupied by the Dead after they were cursed by Isildur at the end of the Second Age
	Race:
	Men
	Culture:
	Men of the Mountains
	A subterranean realm beneath the White Mountains above the valley of the River Morthond. The dwelling place through the Third Age of the Dead, Men cursed by Isildur for breaking their oath of fealty to him, and made to remain in Middle-earth until his rightful heir was to call for their aid.
	Notes
	1
	Isildur laid a curse on the King of the Dead and his people that they would not rest until their broken oath to him was fulfilled, and that curse was the reason that these people haunted the Paths of the Dead.  Isildur laid his curse before he went to war with Sauron, but he couched it in these terms: 'And if the West prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee and thy folk...' (The Return of the King V 2).  The West did indeed prove mighter than Sauron, but not until II 3441, about eleven years after Isildur originally said these words.
	It can't be stated with certainty that the Paths were occupied immediately after the curse took effect: their settlement may have taken years or even decades.  Nonetheless, the curse that founded the Paths of the Dead took effect with the first Fall of Barad-d&#251;r, hence the dating shown above.
	2
	8 March III 3019 is the date that Aragorn led the Dead out of their Paths towards the final fulfilment of their oath, after which the Paths of the Dead would be deserted.  The Dead themselves continued to exist for several days, until they were released by Aragorn at Pelargir on 13 March.

	The Steward to King Ondoher of Gondor, who was thrust into a position of power when his King, together with both his heirs, was lost in battle with the Wainriders.  With the Council of Gondor, it fell to Pelendur to select an heir.  There were two candidates: Arvedui of Arthedain, and E&#228;rnil, the Gondorian Captain and victor of the Battle of the Camp, who was descended from the Royal House of Gondor.As the direct descendant of Isildur himself,  it could be said that Arvedui had the stronger claim, but Pelendur moved the Council to elect E&#228;rnil, who took the Kingship as E&#228;rnil II.  All available evidence suggests that Pelendur continued to serve as Steward under the new King.Pelendur was a highly influential Steward, who accrued considerable power to his office.  As well as effectively acting as regent during the interregnum, it was during his time that the office of Steward became hereditary.  When Pelendur died, he was succeeded as Steward by his son Vorondil, and his grandson Mardil was to become the first of the Stewards to rule Gondor in his own right.

People of the Jewel-smiths

	The Elves of Eregion
	After the establishment of the land of Eregion in the year II 750, the followers of Celebrimbor became famous for their works of art and craft.  They were known as the M&#237;rdain, the jewel-smiths, and formed a brotherhood known as the Gwaith-i-M&#237;rdain, the People of the Jewel-smiths.  Their skill gained them the friendship of the Dwarves of nearby Khazad-d&#251;m, who valued such artistry, but their fascination with the making of things was to bring about their downfall.Nearly five hundred years after Eregion's foundation, a mysterious being appeared among its people.  Calling himself Annatar, he had knowledge and skill beyond even that of the M&#237;rdain, and he offered this knowledge freely to the People of the Jewel-smiths.  They accepted his offer, and for some three hundred years more Annatar taught them.  Eventually, their skills were great enough the begin forging Rings of Power, of which they made many, and their greatest works were the Three Rings Narya, Nenya and Vilya.  Through these Rings, they discovered to their horror that 'Annatar' was none other than their ancient enemy Sauron, who had corrupted their great work to his own ends.  Sauron was enraged at his discovery, and his armies swept across Eriador and into Eregion, destroying the country of the Jewel-smiths.

	Son of Paladin Took II of Great Smials, and later Thain Peregrin I; he travelled with the Company of the Ring.  With Meriadoc Brandybuck, he was separated from the Company at Parth Galen, and taken captive by Orcs.  Escaping into Fangorn Forest, he saw the destruction of Isengard and travelled with Gandalf to Minas Tirith, where he became a bondsman of Steward Denethor II.Journey to Rivendell23 September to 20 October III 3018Pippin, as Peregrin was universally known, was the youngest of Frodo's companions.  He was only twenty-eight years old when he set out with Frodo and Sam from Bag End on the first part of their great journey, which was considered very young for a Hobbit.  At first, he seemed to be rather unsuited to a long journey - through the early part of their travels, we see him regularly calling for rests or meals.  As befitted the son of the Shire's Thain, though, he had a good general knowledge of that land and its people.Peregrin's Life After the War of the RingPeregrin inherited the title Thain of the Shire in the year IV 13 (1434 by the Shire-reckoning).  During his Thainship, he remained in close contact with Gondor, and built a library of great historical importance at Great Smials.  The works he collected were mainly concerned with the history of N&#250;menor and the Exiles after its Downfall, and so were of little interest to the Hobbits of the Shire, but were of great significance to the larger world.  The Tale of Years was probably prepared at Great Smials, with help from Meriadoc Brandybuck.

	A small, stunted people, apparently related to the true Dwarves, who died out in Middle-earth in the late First Age.
	Notes
	1
	All we can say for sure about the origins of the Petty-dwarves is what the Silmarillion tells us, that they '...came of Dwarves that were banished in ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east...' (The Silmarillion 21 'Of T&#250;rin Turambar').  Precisely which cities they had been banished from isn't clear, but they could not be Belegost or Nogrod, as these would not be built until long after the arrival of the Petty-dwarves in Beleriand.  It is by no means impossible, though, that the first ancestors of this hidden, stunted race lived among the glories of old Khazad-d&#251;m.

It seems to have been built in the southern slopes of the Green Hills, and was reached by only a single road, apparently leading from the larger settlement of Longbottom to the south.The origin of Pincup's name are mysterious.  Perhaps the most likely possibility would be Old English p&#237;n cuppe, 'pine hollow', but this is by no means certain.  'Pine hill' is another possibility, though this doesn't fit easily with the fact that the only known map of Pincup shows it below the Green Hills.  More exotically, its name might even be connected with the colourful bird known as a chaffinch, a bird the Anglo-Saxons called a pinca.

	Notes
	1
	The meaning of 'Poros' is almost entirely elusive.  The Etymologies are of little help; they list a word-root, por-, that seems promising until we realize it means 'flour'.  Nor does the name seem to have evolved from phor-, since this implies 'north' while the Poros is emphatically in the south. It is conceivable that the name contains -ros, meaning 'spray'.(The Etymologies appear in The History of Middle-earth Volume 5, The Lost Road and Other Writings).

Queen of Doriath
	[queenofdoriath.txt]
	Melian the Maia
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Pre-First Age to c. I 502
	Location:
	Doriath, among the central forests of Beleriand
	Race:
	Ainur
	Division:
	Maiar of V&#225;na and Est&#235;
	Culture:
	Doriath
	Title&nbsp;of:
	Melian
	In the long years before the beginning of the First Age, the Telerin lord Elw&#235; Singollo came upon Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth.  So Melian became the first and only of the Ainur to wed one of the Children of Il&#250;vatar, and together Thingol (as Elw&#235; became known) and Melian founded a kingdom among the forests in the heart of Beleriand, and ruled it as King and Queen.Throughout much of its existence, the forest-kingdom was known as Eglador.  When Morgoth returned to Middle-earth, he sent his Orc-armies to ravage Beleriand.  They were beaten back, but only at great cost, and so Melian put out her power to protect her country.  She surrounded the forests of her home with a bewildering maze of powerful enchantments, the so-called Girdle of Melian.  From that time, the land she ruled with Thingol was no longer known as Eglador, but took a new name, Doriath, the 'fenced land'.Melian and Thingol ruled in Doriath for some five centuries more.  At last Thingol was slain, in his own treasuries by treacherous Dwarves of Nogrod.  Melian in despair departed for her ancient home in the West of the World, and the Girdle that had protected Doriath was removed.Whether Melian was the last Queen of Doriath is open to question.  Thingol's grandson Dior ruled for some years in Doriath after his grandfather's death, so Dior's spouse Nimloth might possibly have inherited Melian's title.  There is, however, no evidence that Nimloth was ever referred to as the 'Queen of Doriath'.

	Bregalad
	One of the younger Ents of Fangorn Forest belonging to the people of Skinbark.  His name (a translation of Elvish Bregalad) was given because of uncharacteristic hastiness.

	Notes

	Tolkien consistently implies that Quickbeam is one of the younger Ents, but where Ents are concerned, 'young' is a very relative term.  Quickbeam says of himself that he was an Enting 'many many years ago in the quiet of the world'.  This is rather cryptic, but it can be taken to suggest that he predates the First Age.  (Quickbeam's quote comes from The Two Towers IV 3 Treebeard)

	Notes
	1
	In Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien indicates that his father intended to change this derivation and bring Radagast in line with the other wizard-names Gandalf and Saruman, by associating it with the old language of the Men of the Vales of Anduin.  No alternative meaning is provided (indeed, Tolkien stated that the name was 'not now clearly interpretable'). One possible source (a somewhat unfounded conjecture) would be Old English rudug&#225;st, 'brown spirit' (rudu strictly means 'red' or 'red-brown' - it is the source of the modern word 'ruddy').

	In the assault of the Dagor Bragollach, the Men of Dorthonion were overrun by Morgoth's forces. Their lord, Barahir, took the survivors of his House into hiding in the northern highlands, above the pine forests of that region, but they were harried and hunted by Morgoth's servant Sauron, and their numbers dwindled.At last, only thirteen Men remained, and Ragnor was one of these: a faithful servant and soldier of the House of B&#235;or.  One fateful night, as the outlaws slept by the shores of a mountain lake, they were set upon by Orcs and slain to a Man.  Beren was absent from the camp, and survived, but Ragnor and all his companions were lost.
	Notes

	The Etymologies gives us an adjective, ragna, that means 'crooked', but there's no direct evidence to link this with Ragnor's name. (The History of Middle-earth Volume 5, The Lost Road and Other Writings III The Etymologies).

	Words of Tom BombadilThe Fellowship of the Ring I 8 Fog on the Barrow-downs
	After the loss of the kingdom of Arthedain, the descendants of Isildur's line survived in the wilds of Middle-earth, and became skilled in hunting and woodcraft; their warriors were known as the Rangers among the peoples of the north.
	Notes
	1
	There is very little information available about the founding of the Rangers, except that they emerged from the remnant of the D&#250;nedain who survived the fall of Arthedain.  As is hardly surprising, they seem not to have appeared immediately after the loss of the North-kingdom (no Rangers are mentioned at the Battle of Fornost in the following year).  More likely, they appeared in the years following the fall, probably under the first Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain, Aranarth.We're also lacking any definite records of the fate of the Rangers.  It's possible that their role came to an end after the War of the Ring, but its equally plausible that Aragorn would have used them to maintain order in the newly-refounded North-kingdom.

Rangers of the North

	The descendants of the D&#250;nedain of Arnor
	The northern people more commonly known simply as the Rangers, the last remnant of the D&#250;nedain who had once peopled the North-kingdom of Arnor.  They were led by a line of Chieftains, each of whom could trace his descent back to Isildur himself.  At the time of the War of the Ring, the Chieftain of the D&#250;nedain was Aragorn, but the people he led were scattered and diminished.  When Halbarad D&#250;nadan led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in the War, he could muster no more than thirty for the ride.
	The term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived in the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this people from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien.  Like the Rangers of the North, these were also D&#250;nedain, but they belonged to the South-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the Northern D&#250;nedain for some three thousand years.

The Stewards had a House apart from the tombs of the Kings, the House of Stewards, where Denethor perished in 3019 (Third Age).When the seedling of the White Tree was found on the slopes of Mindolluin by Gandalf, the Dead Tree that had stood in the courts of Minas Tirith was laid in Rath D&#237;nen, and the hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, of the Company of the Ring, were also given a place there after their deaths, beside the tomb of King Aragorn Elessar.

Reckoning of Rivendell

	The Calendar of Imladris
	Race:
	Elves
	Culture:
	Rivendell
	The Reckoning of Rivendell or Imladris is the only recorded Elvish calendar.  It contained six 'months' (more akin to seasons), rather than twelve, and its arrangement reflects the Elvish preference for counting in sixes and twelves.  Because of their long lifespan, the Elves tended to divide time into Y&#233;ni of 144 years each, but they also had a period equivalent to a year, called a Loa or Coranar.Rather than adding one day every four years, as with the modern leap year, the Elves instead added three days every twelve years.  In these years, the Enderi ('middle-days') of each year were doubled from the usual three to six.  For precision, the last year of every third y&#233;n was shortened by three days, rather than lengthened (the last year of a y&#233;n was always a 'leap' year).  This was a rare occurrence, happening only once every 432 years.QuenyaSindarinLengthShire CalendarEquivalentModernEquivalentYestar&#235;-1 day6 April28 MarchTuil&#235;Ethuil54 days7 April-30 May29 March-21 MayLair&#235;Laer72 days1 June-9 August22 May-1 AugustY&#225;vi&#235;Iavas54 days10 August-3 October2 August-24 SeptemberEnderi-3 days(see note above)4 October-6 October25 September-27 SeptemberQuell&#235;(or Lasse-lanta)Firith(or Narbeleth)54 days7 October-30 November28 September-20 NovemberHr&#237;v&#235;Rh&#238;w72 days1 December-10 February21 November-31 JanuaryCoir&#235;Echuir54 days11 February-4 April1 February-26 MarchMettar&#235;-1 day5 April27 March

	&nbsp;&#149; Hirgon
	An arrow sent as a symbol of desperate need from Gondor to its northern allies, the Rohirrim.  Its flights were black and its barbs were made of steel, and it took its name from a mark of red painted on the arrow's tip.  The origins of the tradition of the Red Arrow are obscure, but it seems to date back to the time of Borondir, who rode north from Gondor to summon aid from the ancestors of the Rohirrim, the &#201;oth&#233;od, in III 2509.  Borondir was one of six messengers, the only one of the six to escape the orc-arrows of Dol Guldur, and the black feathers of the Red Arrow perhaps commemorate this feat by representing the arrows of the Orcs.
	The Red Arrow was only sent north in the most perilous of circumstances.  Though Gondor had been battling their foes for many years before the War of the Ring began in earnest, the Arrow had not been used to summon help from Rohan at any time during Th&#233;oden's reign.  With the Siege of Gondor fast approaching, Denethor sent the Arrow at last with a messenger named Hirgon.  Th&#233;oden answered the summons, and brought his Riders to Gondor's aid in the great Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

Red Book of Westmarch
	[redbook.txt]
	The legendary source of Tolkien&#146;s tales
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Predates III 30011Survived until at least IV 1722
	Origins:
	Originally the private diary of Bilbo Baggins, greatly annotated and expanded
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Red Book of the Periannath
	In origin the diary and commentaries of Bilbo Baggins, with additions by his heir Frodo, the Red Book was the original source for the tales we know as The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
	Notes
	1
	The first definite mention of the Red Book is in the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings, which states that Bilbo took it with him when he left the Shire in III 3001.  It was in a very unfinished state at this point; the important Translations from the Elvish would not be added until after Bilbo's arrival at Rivendell.  Nevertheless, it must have predated Bilbo's departure by some time, and may even date back to his journey to Erebor sixty years before.
	2
	We know that the Red Book survived at least until IV 172, because a Gondorian scribe named Findegil completed a copy of it in that year (this is, incidentally, the last definitely dated event anywhere in Tolkien's work).  It did not last indefinitely, however, as the Prologue tells us: 'The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made...'

Huan, it was prophesied, could only be slain by the greatest of all wolves, and Carcharoth the Red Maw proved to be that wolf.  Before the gates of Angband, he bit Beren's hand from his arm, and with it the Silmaril he carried.  Burned by the power of the Jewel, Carcharoth fled into the south.  At last, he was discovered within the borders of Doriath itself, where he fought his last fight with Huan: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat.

In all the history of the South-kingdom, only one Regent of this kind was ever appointed - Minalcar son of Calmacil.Minalcar was the grandson of Atanatar Alcarin, and already in the closing years of his grandfather's rule, he had become a forceful presence in the councils of the King, especially since neither of Atanatar's sons, Narmacil nor Calmacil, showed great interest in affairs of state.  Just a few short years after Narmacil succeeded his father as King, he conferred the office of Karma-kundo on his nephew Minalcar, who from that point effectively ruled Gondor, though officially doing so in the King's name.Minalcar would eventually ascend to the throne of Gondor himself under his better-known name R&#243;mendacil II.  Before doing so, though, he was Gondor's Regent for no less than sixty-four years.

	The doubts of Melian,from Quenta Silmarillion 15, Of the Noldor in Beleriand
	In the darkness before the Sun and Moon, the Elves who dwelt under the starlit skies of Beleriand suffered a great calamity: Melkor, who had been taken as prisoner into the West thousands of years before, returned suddenly to the northern lands, and settled again in his fortress of Angband.  After his return, Orcs stalked the lands of Middle-earth, and though Doriath was protected by the power of its Queen, there was war elsewhere in Beleriand.
	In that time, without warning, F&#235;anor and the Noldor returned out of the West and fought a great battle, called the Dagor-nuin-Giliath ('Battle-under-Stars') in which the creatures of Morgoth were utterly defeated.  Soon after, Fingolfin and his followers, also of the Noldor, crossed into Middle-earth, and their arrival was heralded by the first rising of the Moon, followed soon after the appearance of the Sun.
	To the Elves dwelling in Beleriand at the time, the coming of these princes must have seemed little short of miraculous, and indeed they were generally held to be emissaries of the Valar, sent to aid the Sindar and their allies against Morgoth's power.  It was afterwards discovered that this was not the truth: far from being messengers out of Valinor, they were exiles, cursed by Mandos, many with the blood of their kin on their hands.  F&#235;anor had led them back to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth and the Silmarils he had stolen, and their wars with the Dark Lord would destroy all the kingdoms of Beleriand and even, in the end, the land itself.
	Notes
	1
	The Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth was the result of the Flight of the Noldor from Aman.  In fact, the entire journey out of Aman to the coasts of Middle-earth seems to have taken about nineteen years to complete, with the Return being achieved as the Moon rose for the first time.  The first Sunrise occurred soon after, marking the beginning of the First Age.

Reunited Kingdom

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Formed in III 3019
	Location:
	The old lands of Arnor and Gondor, covering most of the northwestern parts of Middle-earth
	Origins:
	Established by its first King, Aragorn Elessar, after the ultimate defeat of Sauron
	Race:
	Men (and incorporating the Shire and other settlements of Hobbits)
	Meaning:
	Named for the reunification of the Two Kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain, Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south
	&quot;...and the Heir of Isildur was crowned King of Gondor and Arnor, and the might of the Dúnedain was lifted up and their glory renewed.&quot;
	Of the Rings of Power and the Third Agefrom The Silmarillion
	At the end of the Second Age, Elendil and his sons established two great kingdoms in Middle-earth: Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south.  These Kingdoms of the D&#250;nedain were united under a single High King, Elendil himself, who ruled the North-kingdom while his sons reigned jointly over the South-kindom of Gondor.  In the first years of the Third Age, this union failed.  After the loss of Isildur at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, his nephew Meneldil took up the kingship of Gondor, and that country remained independent from the North-kingdom through most of the Third Age.
	In the north, the realm of Arnor fell into troubled times.  It broke into three separate kingdoms, and in time these too were lost, so that the D&#250;nedain of the North-kingdom of Elendil were reduced to a wandering people led by a Chieftain.  Nonetheless, they were able to maintain Isildur's line in unbroken descent, while the Kings failed in Gondor, and its rule was taken up by the Stewards.
	There were two attempts to reunite the kingdoms.  The first of these occurred in III 1944, when Arvedui of Arthedain claimed the High Kingship of the Two Kingdoms.  His claim was rejected by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, who elected to maintain their independence.  More than a thousand years later, after the War of the Ring, Arvedui's direct descendant Aragorn came forward to make the same claim.  This time, the people of Gondor accepted a High King, and the Two Kingdoms were reunited at last.
	Like his ancestor Elendil before him, Aragorn took up his rule from the North-kingdom, but he travelled throughout his wide lands.  The Shire was an exception to this, and though it lay within the Reunited Kingdom, Aragorn made a law that Men should not enter it, a law that he observed himself.  Though his seat was in the north, Minas Tirith and the South-kingdom remained important, to the extent that he travelled there at the end of his life, and his tomb was among the Houses of the Dead beneath Mount Mindolluin.  After Aragorn's death, his son Eldarion took up the High Kingship, and the Reunited Kingdom endured for many years under the new King and his descendants.

Revised Calendar

	The Stewards&#146; Reckoning
	The N&#250;men&#243;rean calendar was devised during the Second Age, but even after the fall of Sauron at the end of that Age, the old calendar was maintained by the Exiles of N&#250;menor in Middle-earth into the Third Age.  The change of Age, though, introduced an error into the calendar that its designers had not foreseen, so that eventually a thorough revision became necessary.  That revision was introduced by Mardil Voronw&#235;, whose Revised Calendar consisted of twelve months, each of thirty days, and five additional days that belonged to no month. This Revised Calendar, more commonly called the Stewards' Reckoning, was introduced nearly a thousand years before the War of the Ring, and became the standard calendar of Middle-earth.

	The little-known lands in the far east of Middle-earth, from where many attacks on Gondor and its allies came during the Third Age.We know almost nothing of the lands of beyond the great Sea of Rh&#251;n that stood on its borders with the western lands.  Even Gandalf had never explored there, and though Aragorn had travelled there, we have no report of his doings.Of its ancient geography we can glean a little from the Silmarillion; far beyond the Sea of Rh&#251;n was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar, and beyond that a range of red mountains known as the Orocarni.  Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Cuivi&#233;nen and Hild&#243;rien, where Elves and Men first awoke: all the Children of Il&#250;vatar could trace their ancestries back to the eastward regions of Middle-earth.Rh&#251;n was far from an empty land; it was the domain of the Easterlings, Men of Darkness who were ready to follow both the Dark Lords and fought as their allies in war.  These lands, too, were peopled by lost Elves, Avari and &#218;manyar, and by four of the seven clans of the Dwarves.During the Third Age, Rh&#251;n was visited by three Wizards; Saruman, Alatar and Pallando, and though Saruman returned into the west, the two Blue Wizards remained.  Sauron himself journeyed into the eastward lands, in hiding from the White Council during the centuries known in the west as the Watchful Peace.

The Ring
	[ring.txt]
	Sauron&#146;s One Ring to bind all Rings
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Forged in c. II 1600, destroyed on 25 March III 3019 (4,860 years)
	Other&nbsp;names:
	The Great Ring, Isildur's Bane, The One Ring, Precious, The Ruling Ring
	The powerful artefact of Sauron more properly called the One Ring or the Ruling Ring.The Ring was born out of a plan Sauron devised to enslave the peoples of Middle-earth.  He took on the form of a wise adviser, under the name Annatar, and offered great knowledge to the Elves.  Many rejected him, but Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion accepted his offer, and he schooled them in the making of Rings of Power.  At last, Annatar and the Elves made sixteen jewelled Rings that would in time become the Seven Rings of the Dwarves and the Nine Rings of Men.Now Sauron put his scheme into motion.  Returning to his land of Mordor, to the forges of Sammath Naur in the heart of Mount Doom, he began the secret making of another Ring.  He filled it with his own power and malice, to wield power over all the other Rings of Power, and bind their wearers to his will.His plan failed.  The Elves, too, had made themselves Rings so powerful that when Sauron took up his Ruling Ring, they perceived that they were betrayed.  Taking off their own Rings, they escaped the trap that Sauron had set for them. In anger, Sauron swept out of Mordor with his armies; Eregion was destroyed, Celebrimbor was slain, and Sauron recovered fifteen of the Rings of Power (the Three Rings of the Elves had been sent into secret hiding, and one of the original sixteen had already been given by Celebrimbor to Durin III of Khazad-d&#251;m).Under the binding power of the Ring, Sauron subverted nine Men, whose Rings of Power twisted them slowly into wraiths, the Nazg&#251;l, whose only will was Sauron's.  He attempted the same with Dwarves, but they proved resistant to the Rings' powers, and those of their Rings that were not destroyed the Dark Lord reclaimed.  The power of Sauron's Ruling Ring was such, though, that it wielded power over the wills of lesser beings whether or not they wore another Ring.  In Tolkien's Letters, we're told that he used it to bring about nothing less than the destruction of N&#250;menor, by corrupting the will of its King, Ar-Pharaz&#244;n, and his followers.What Sauron could not have foreseen was that the Downfall of N&#250;menor would ultimately bring about his own destruction, and the loss of his Ring.  Nine ships escaped the Downfall and landed in Middle-earth, carrying Elendil and his sons Isildur and An&#225;rion.  Together, they founded great realms in Middle-earth, and allied themselves with Gil-galad and the Elves against Sauron.  So began the long War of the Last Alliance, in which Sauron was at last defeated, and his Ring taken by Isildur.  But Isildur did not hold the Ring for long.  He was set upon by orcs on the banks of the Great River, and the Ring was lost in its depths, where it would lie for two and a half millennia.It was found at last by D&#233;agol, a creature of hobbit-kind, and then passed through a strange series of events. No sooner had D&#233;agol recovered it than he was killed by his companion Sm&#233;agol, who stole the Ring for himself.  Driven out by his family, who gave him the name Gollum, he wandered into the depths beneath the Misty Mountains, and there he lurked for more than five centuries, his life stretched by the power of the Ring.  By a twist of fate, he lost it, and it came into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, lost and wandering in the depths where Gollum dwelt.Bilbo carried it through adventure and battle, eventually bringing it back to the Shire.  It passed to his heir Frodo, and at last its identity was discovered by the Wizard Gandalf.  Over the centuries, Sauron had recovered much of his strength, and he too learned that the Ring had been found, and discovered that it was held in the Shire.  So began the War of the Ring, a desperate race to destroy Sauron's Ring in the fires of its birth, before its Lord could reclaim it and use its power to enslave the World.

	Hands that held the One Ring
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	The One Ring was forged in c. II 1600, and destroyed on 25 March III 3019
	Race:
	Hobbits
	The title used for those three Hobbits (Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee) who had at one time borne the One Ring, and aided in its destruction.  Because of their status as Ring-bearers, they were granted the passage of the Straight Road, and each eventually went to the Blessed Realm to live out their lives.Though only these three Hobbits are strictly counted as Ring-bearers, in fact the Ring was borne by other hands besides.  Those who actually wore the Ring, as opposed to picking it up or holding it, are shown in bold.SauronHe forged the One Ring for himself in c.1600 (Second Age) and bore it for c.1,840 years until his defeat in the Siege of Barad-d&#251;r in 3441 (Second Age).IsildurAgainst the advice of Elrond and C&#237;rdan, he took the Ring for himself.  He did not bear it long - two years later, Isildur was ambushed by Orcs and the One Ring was lost in the Anduin, where it lay hidden for most of the Third Age.D&#233;agolHe discovered the Ring while fishing the Gladden Fields in about the year III 2463.  He held it for only a short time before he was murdered by his friend Sm&#233;agol (Gollum), who stole the Ring for himself.GollumHe took the Ring from D&#233;agol, and soon hid with it in the roots of the Misty Mountains.  He bore it in the dark for almost five hundred years.Bilbo BagginsHe discovered the Ring 'by accident' while imprisoned beneath the Misty Mountains in July1 2941, and claimed it from Gollum by defeating him in a Riddle-game.  He carried it eastward to Erebor, and then back westward to the Shire, where he kept it.  He bore the Ring for almost exactly sixty years.Frodo BagginsHe was given the Ring by Bilbo on the advice of Gandalf.  He was the Ring-bearer, who carried the One Ring from the Shire to Orodruin, to the very brink of the Cracks of Doom. Once there, the Ring's power overmastered him, and he named it to himself, but Gollum bit it from his finger and fell into the Fire.  Frodo bore the Ring for seventeen years until its destruction.GandalfHe held it for a matter of moments on the morning of 13 April III 3018, before throwing it into Frodo's fire.  This was the moment that the Ring's fiery inscription appeared, confirming that it was the One Ring.Tom BombadilHe wore it on his finger for a moment on 27 September III 3018, but was famously unaffected by it.  The reason that Tom was immune was the effects of the Ring remains an abiding mystery.Samwise GamgeeHe bore the Ring for about two days in March 3019 (Third Age), while Frodo his master was in the clutches of Orcs in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

	An important river of the southern regions of Gondor.  It rose in the White Mountains above Lamedon, and flowed southwestwards for some 200 miles before it met the sea.  Near its mouth was the ancient Elf-haven of Edhellond, and it marked the border between Anfalas to the west and Belfalas to the east.
	Notes

	Tolkien never directly translates the name Ringl&#243; himself, but the elements ring 'cold' and l&#243; 'flood, fen' are well established.  The l&#243; element is commonly seen in the names of rivers that flooded the lands around them, or flowed through fenlands: compare, for example, Gwathl&#243; ('Greyflood') or Onodl&#243; ('Entwash').

	The magical rings made by Sauron and the M&#237;rdain
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Forged between c. II 1500 and c. II 1600.  With the destruction of the One Ring in III 3019, the surviving Rings lost their Power.

	Made by the Elves of Eregion, under the instruction of Sauron. Sauron was said to have had no part in the making of the Three Rings, while he alone made the One Ring.
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Great Rings
	Eregion was a land founded by the Noldor in the eighth century of the Second Age.  Their leader was Celebrimbor, the grandson of F&#235;anor himself, and their skill and smithwork became famous throughout Middle-earth.  In about the year II 1200, they began to receive emissaries from a mysterious stranger calling himself Annatar, who offered them even greater knowledge of their arts.  Despite warnings from Gil-galad and Elrond, they accepted Annatar's offer, and he came to Eregion to teach them.For three hundred years the M&#237;rdain - as the Jewel-smiths of Eregion were known - studied at Annatar's side, and learned the making of magical rings.  In about the year II 1500, the first of the Rings of Power was forged.  Over the following decades, with Annatar's help, the Elves made sixteen Rings of Power, each set with a gemstone.  Both the Elves and Annatar had their own secret aims, though, and each forged work of their own.  Celebrimbor and the Elves made Three Rings more powerful than the others, Narya, Nenya and Vilya, the Rings of Fire, Water and Air.Unknown to the M&#237;rdain, 'Annatar' was none other than the Dark Lord Sauron.  In the fires of Mount Doom in the dark land of Mordor, he forged a Ring of his own, to enslave the holders of the other Rings of Power.  Filled with much of his own native power, this was the Ruling Ring, the One Ring that would make him Lord of all the Rings.  But Sauron had not reckoned on the Elves forging their own Rings of Power; as he took up the One Ring for the first time, they became aware of it, and took off their own Rings to foil his ambition.Sauron in his anger swept out of Mordor with a great army.  The land of Eregion was overwhelmed and destroyed and Celebrimbor was slain.  The Three Rings of the Elves had already been sent away, but the Dark Lord claimed the remaining Rings of Power1.  Nine of these he used to subvert nine Men to his cause; this was the origin of the Nazg&#251;l or Ringwraiths.  Seven he gave to the Dwarves with the same purpose, though with much less success, as the Dwarves proved resistant to their magic.Centuries later, at the end of the Second Age, Sauron fell in the War of the Last Alliance.  Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, but he was lost in the River Anduin, and the Ruling Ring was lost with him.  So the Elves could once again use the power of their Three Rings, as they did through the Third Age.  At last, the One Ring was found again, and Sauron's quest to retrieve it resulted in the War of the Ring.  Ultimately, the Ring was destroyed in the place where Sauron had forged it nearly five thousand years earlier.  With that, the remaining Rings of Power, including even the Elves' Three Rings, lost the power they had held.
	Notes
	1
	There was a tradition among the Dwarves of Durin's Folk that Celebrimbor had already given them one of the Rings of Power before Sauron attacked. At this time, Durin's Folk still lived in their ancient home of Khazad-d&#251;m, neighbouring Eregion to the east, and there was great friendship between the Elves and the Dwarves.  According to the Dwarves, Celebrimbor gave a Ring as a gift to the then King of Khazad-d&#251;m, Durin III.  Hence, Sauron would have recovered fifteen of the Rings, not all sixteen.

Ro&#228;c was a very ancient bird indeed: his father Carc had seen Smaug descend on the mountain, and Ro&#228;c was no less than one hundred and fifty-three years old ('out of the egg', as he put it) when he met Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor.  It was Ro&#228;c who told the adventurers that Smaug was dead, and who arranged for messages to be passed between Thorin and D&#225;in Ironfoot in preparation for the troubles that followed.

	Founded in III 2510.  Still extant during the Fourth Age
	Race:
	Men
	Culture:
	Rohirrim
	Location:

	Meaning:
	From Rochand, meaning 'horse-land'
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	The Mark, The Riddermark
	Originally the Gondorian province of Calenardhon, the land north of the White Mountains was gifted by Steward Cirion to Eorl of the Northmen in 2510 (Third Age). Eorl had led his men through great hardship from the far north to the aid of Gondor, and Cirion gave him the wide green lands of Calenardhon in recognition of his aid, swearing eternal friendship between old Gondor and the new land of Rohan.Rohan's history was one of conflict and war; with the Orcs of the White Mountains, the Dunlendings to the west, and ultimately with Saruman in Orthanc, whose lands bordered Rohan to the north.Nonetheless, the line of the Kings of Rohan stretched from Eorl's time to the War of the Ring and beyond.  The Kings sat in the Golden Hall of Meduseld in Edoras, built by Eorl's son Brego.  At the time of Gondor's greatest need, they kept the Oath of Eorl, and rode to the aid of their ancient allies at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

	Notes
	1
	A rohir is a lord (hir) who rides a horse (roch); a word that could reasonably be translated 'knight'.  In many languages, the word for knight makes specific reference to his steed, as in French chevalier or Latin equus, but this link has been lost in English.  The Elvish word rohir appears in one other important place, the name of Elrond's son Elrohir, which means 'Elf-knight'.

	&nbsp;&#149; Turambar King of Gondor
	The heir of Ostoher, who succeeded his father to become Gondor's eighth King.  His name had originally been Tarostar, but he changed it to R&#243;mendacil to reflect the heroic events surrounding his succession.While his father Ostoher was still King, a horde of Easterlings attacked Gondor, the first time such a thing had been known.  Ostoher was too old to take command of his own armies, so his son Tarostar took over the kingdom's defence.  After two years of fighting, the old King died, and Tarostar inherited the Crown.  Another eight years of warfare followed, but in the end Tarostar defeated his enemies and saved Gondor.  He took the name R&#243;mendacil in celebration of his triumph; it means 'East-victor'.Neither R&#243;mendacil's triumph, nor Gondor's peace, were to last indefinitely.  Some forty years after his first victory, the Easterlings massed once more, and again attacked the South-kingdom.  R&#243;mendacil did not survive the assault, and it was left to his heir Turambar to face the fierce eastern warriors.R&#243;mendacil ruled Gondor for forty-nine years, and was succeeded by his son Turambar.

	R&#211;MENDACIL II

	Valacar
	The Man who would one day rule as one of Gondor's greatest Kings entered the World in inauspicious circumstances.  He was born with the name Minalcar during the reign of Hyarmendacil II, and his father was Calmacil, the younger brother of the King's grandson Narmacil. As such, there seemed little likelihood of his succeeding the throne, but fate would decide otherwise.His uncle Narmacil took Gondor's throne in the year III 1226.  Narmacil was not a man suited to the rigours of Kingship, and chose instead to appoint a Regent to rule the Kingdom in his stead.  His choice settled on his nephew Minalcar, who took up the Regency in III 1240.  Having been given this authority, Minalcar acted swiftly to secure Gondor's borders.  He built a huge army, and marched with it into the east were he destroyed the Easterling forces between Rhovanion and the Sea of Rh&#251;n.  After this great event, he took a title first used by his ancestor Tarostar in the sixth century, R&#243;mendacil the East-victor.Not satisfied with his great victory in the east, R&#243;mendacil set about fortifying the River Anduin.  It was he who built the Pillars of the Argonath above Nen Hithoel, as a warning and a marker of Gondor's then northern border.  He developed less tangible defences, too, working to cement a bond between Gondor and the Northmen who lived to the east.  He went so far to send his son Valacar to live among them, an act from which the evils of the Kin-strife would eventually develop.Had Narmacil had a son, Minalcar R&#243;mendacil's Regency would have ended with his uncle's death in III 1294.  Narmacil died without an heir, however, and his brother, Minalcar's father Calmacil, succeeded instead.  Calmacil was King in name only, for he allowed his illustrious son to continue to rule as Regent.  On the death of his father ten years later, the man who had actually been ruling Gondor for the previous sixty-four years finally became its true King, under his famous name R&#243;mendacil II.R&#243;mendacil II ruled as Regent for sixty-four years and as King of Gondor for a further sixty-two years.  He was succeeded by his son Valacar.

	The extended house of the nobles and royalty of Gondor, descended from its first Kings.  The house included the Kings of Gondor and their heirs, of course, but also their siblings and their descendants.  On several occasions, the direct line of descent failed in Gondor, and other members of the house were called on to take up the Kingship.  Most notable among these was Meneldil himself, the first King to rule Gondor in his own right, who took up the throne on the death of his uncle Isildur.There are examples of members of the Royal House being granted important military roles.  For example, the great Gondorian general E&#228;rnil was a member of the Royal House, being a descendant of Telumehtar, great-grandfather to the reigning King Ondoher.  Indeed, when Ondoher and his heirs were lost, E&#228;rnil eventually succeeded to the Kingship himself.One important political role, however, was closed to members of the Royal House: that of Steward. When R&#243;mendacil I created the Stewardship, he specified that no member of the House should ever take the role.  The descendants of the House of H&#250;rin, who would eventually take on the hereditary Stewardship of the realm, were noted as being of high N&#250;men&#243;rean blood, but they were not members of the Royal House itself.

	First devised by Daeron of Doriath1
	Meaning:
	From Old Norse r&#250;n, meaning a magical symbol2
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Cirth
	A system of writing based on angular shapes that could easily be carved into wood or stone. Originated by Daeron of Doriath to represent Sindarin words, runes came to be used widely by races other than the Elves, and especially by the Dwarves.
	Notes
	1
	Actually, of course, runes are a real historical family of alphabets originating in about the third century CE, and those in Tolkien's books are based on a much later form belonging the Anglo-Saxon period.  In Tolkien's universe, it seems that our historical runes supposedly descended from those of Daeron.  Indeed, while comparing the Dwarvish and Anglo-Saxon runic alphabets, Tolkien says, 'There is doubtless an historical connection between the two.' (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 24, dated 1938).
	2
	In Norse tradition, runes held a magical significance, and 'casting the runes' was a way of seeing into the future. There are no such magical connotations associated with runes in Tolkien's work, where they are presented as no more than a writing-system.On the topic of the origins of runes, it should be noted that while our modern word 'rune' is certainly descended from the Old Norse r&#250;n, it also seems to have been influenced by an Old English verb r&#250;nian, 'to whisper', so that runes are literally 'whispering signs'.

	This river is usually called the 'River Running', but from time to time, particulary in The Hobbit, it is referred to as the 'Running River'.  The two terms are interchangeable.
	Also called the Celduin, the Running was a great river that formed the eastern boundary of Rhovanion. It rose beneath Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, and flowed southeastwards for many hundreds of miles to its outflow into the Sea of Rh&#251;n.

	Since its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a secretive war against Morgoth, hunting their enemies by stealth and ambush rather than going to open war.  When T&#250;rin was led there by Gwindor, though, he counselled a different strategy to Orodreth, who had by that time succeeded his brother Finrod as King in Nargothrond.  Orodreth therefore built a bridge from his doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth.This was a foolhardy strategy.  In centuries of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of Nargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new bridge removed the defence of the River Narog.  Glaurung was sent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city.The army of Nargothrond went out to meet Glaurung on the field of Tumhalad, some miles north of the citadel. They were routed, and those Elves left in the city awaiting their return, instead found the Dragon and his Orcs crossing their bridge and entering the citadel.  These people, including Orodreth's daughter Finduilas, were captured by the Orcs and driven northward.Coming late to the sack were T&#250;rin and some few other survivors of the Battle of Tumhalad.  At the sight of the Dragon, T&#250;rin's companions fled, but T&#250;rin himself was placed under Glaurung's dragon-spell, and forced to watch as the captives were driven away.  Then Glaurung released T&#250;rin, knowing the evils this would cause, and settled to enjoy his newly-sacked domain.

	Notes
	1
	The date of Sam's birthday is not certain.  This date is given in Appendix D of The Lord of the Rings as the date of celebrations on the Party Field in Hobbiton.  One explanation is that this was Sam's birthday, but an alternative reason is that this is also the date of the Elvish new year (called Yestar&#235;).  It is possible, of course, that both explanations are correct, and Sam happened to have been born on this auspicious day.
	2
	The year of Sam's birth is not absolutely certain.  The date of III 2983 shown here follows the Tale of Years in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, but the family trees in Appendix C date Sam's birth as SR 1380 (that is III 2980, three years earlier than the Tale of Years date).  Tolkien seems to have added the reference in the Tale of Years at a comparatively late stage - it may represent a correction to the original date (which then remained in the family trees by mistake) or it may be an error in itself.

	Most often called Saruman the White, Saruman was the first of the five Wizards to arrive in Middle-earth, at the end of the first millennium of the Third Age.  He was said to be the eldest of the order, and Gandalf acknowledged him as the chief of the Istari.For a thousand years, and maybe more, he journeyed in the East of Middle-earth, and was little heard of in the West.  He had returned, though, by III 2463, for he was present at the foundation of the Council of the Wise, and was made their chief (though both Elrond and Galadriel would have preferred Gandalf to take this position).It was at about this time that Saruman began to study the Rings of Power, their history and the means of their making.In III 2759, he was given the keys of Orthanc by Steward Beren of Minas Tirith, and took up his abode there.  He continued his researches into ring-lore, and the making of devices, and was accustomed to watch the stars from the pinnacle of the Tower.  He visited Minas Tirith to research the history of the Rings, and found among the ancient books and scrolls the story of the death of Isildur and the loss of the Ruling Ring.In III 2851, the Council discovered proof that the Necromancer of Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron returned.  Many of the Wise wished to attack the fortress and drive Sauron out, but Saruman spoke against this, and dissuaded the Council from mounting an assault.  It was only after ninety years had passed that he relented and aided the Council in assailing Dol Guldur, driving Sauron back into Mordor.  Saruman's knowledge was vital in this victory, as Gandalf said - 'it was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur'.When the Council debated the Rings of Power, Saruman claimed that his researches showed that the One Ring had been lost forever.  It was later shown that he did not believe this, however, and was searching for it himself, having secretly rebelled against the Council.He built an army of Wolves and Orcs of his own within the ring of Isengard to challenge both Sauron and the Wise, and took control of the only nearby power, the country of Rohan, through his agent Gr&#237;ma Wormtongue.In July III 3018, when he was ready to reveal himself, Saruman set a trap for Gandalf, using the Wizard Radagast to lure him to Orthanc. When Gandalf came, Saruman revealed that he had made a Ring of his own, and that he was no longer Saruman the White, but claimed the title Saruman of Many Colours. When Gandalf refused to join him, he was imprisoned on the pinnacle of the Tower of Orthanc - Saruman hoped to gain the secret of the One Ring from him, or at least prevent Gandalf from using it himself.

	Pronunciation:
	sowro'n ('ow' as in 'now')
	&quot;Of old there was Sauron the Maia.&quot;
	Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age
	Originally a Maia of Aul&#235;'s people, Sauron was early corrupted by Melkor and became his most trusted lieutenant.  In the Wars of Beleriand, Sauron was the most feared of Morgoth's servants, but after the War of Wrath and the expulsion of the first Dark Lord, Sauron rose to become the greatest enemy of Elves and Men in the Second and Third Ages.Sauron's History Before the First AgeSauron was one of the mightiest (perhaps the mightiest) of the Maiar, and in the beginning of days he served Aul&#235; the Smith.  From Aul&#235; he learnt much of forging and making, knowledge that he would make use of many thousands of years later when he built the Barad-d&#251;r and forged the One Ring.In the earliest days, Melkor seduced Sauron and took him into his own service, and Sauron became the greatest and most trusted of his followers.  While Utumno still stood in the dark north of the world, Sauron was given command of his lesser fortress of Angband.  At length, the Valar assaulted Melkor and took him in chains back to Valinor, but Sauron escaped, and remained in Middle-earth. Sauron in the First AgeWhile Melkor was captive in Aman, Angband was made ready for his return, and it must be assumed that Sauron had a large part in this work.  After the Darkening of Valinor, Melkor returned indeed to Middle-earth, and took up his abode in Angband.  Soon after, he travelled for a while into the eastern lands to seek the newly-awakened Men leaving Sauron in command of his forces once again.Though Sauron doubtless continued his evil works in the service of his lord, we hear nothing of these for many centuries after the return of Morgoth, until the days after the Dagor Bragollach.  For two years after the Dagor Bragollach itself, Finrod's tower of Minas Tirith had guarded the Pass of Sirion against Morgoth's forces.  In 457 (First Age), Sauron himself came against the tower; he cast a spell of fear upon the Elves who held it, and they were slain or fled back to Finrod in Nargothrond.Sauron then took Minas Tirith to dwell in, and watched the Pass of Sirion himself from its topmost tower.  The isle on which it stood, which had been called Tol Sirion, was renamed Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves.After the Dagor Bragollach, the last remnant of the House of B&#235;or became a scattered people. Barahir, its lord, took shelter in the uplands of Dorthonion at Tarn Aeluin with his son Beren and eleven others and was hidden for a while from Morgoth.  Sauron was sent to find and destroy this desperate band of outlaws.  This he did by capturing Gorlim, one of Barahir's followers, and using his sorcery he discovered the outlaws' camp, and destroyed all of Barahir's band but his son Beren.Beren himself fled southwards through the treacherous paths of the Ered Gorgoroth, and Sauron's army of werewolves failed to capture him.  Fate drove Beren into Sauron's hands eventually, though: some years later as he travelled northward on the Quest of the Silmaril, Sauron captured him with Finrod and their companions and imprisoned them in Tol-in-Gaurhoth.Sauron knew nothing of Beren's quest; sensing some danger to himself or his master, he sent wolves out throughout the lands of the Elves, and meanwhile he flung Beren, Finrod and their companions into a deep pit.  There they were devoured one after the other by one of his werewolves, and eventually all were lost but Beren. As the werewolf slew Finrod, though, L&#250;thien came upon Sauron's Isle with Huan, the Hound of Valinor.  Sauron sent wolf after wolf to investigate L&#250;thien's song, and each was slain in turn by Huan.  At last, he sent Draugluin, the mightiest wolf that had then lived, and he too was mortally wounded by Huan, but with his dying breath he returned to Sauron and warned him of the danger.So Sauron went himself to one of his greatest defeats.  He took the form known as Wolf-Sauron, the shape of a mighty werewolf, and went out to meet his foes.  First, he attacked L&#250;thien, but under her enchantment he stumbled, and Huan sprang upon him.  Though he shifted shape and struggled, he could not escape; at last he yielded the tower to L&#250;thien,and Huan released him.  He fled eastward then to Dorthonion, where he dwelt in the dark pine forests of Taur-nu-Fuin.Sauron in the Second AgeAfter the War of Wrath and the defeat of his master Morgoth, Sauron fled for a time into the east of the world.2  A period of one thousand years followed in which Sauron was not seen in the west of Middle-earth. As the first millennium of the Second Age turned, Sauron came back.  He took the fenced and mountainous land of Mordor, and there began building his mighty Dark Tower of Barad-d&#251;r.The beginning of Sauron's reign as Dark Lord can be dated from this time: he set himself no less a goal than the conquest of Middle-earth, and perhaps even of N&#250;menor itself.For six hundred years, he pursued a dual strategy.  In the guise of Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, he tutored the Elves of Eregion, teaching them the secret things that only a Maia of Aul&#235;'s people could know.  From his lore, the Rings of Power were forged, but while he worked with the Elves, he continued the fortification of Mordor to make it an unassailable stronghold.In the fire-mountain of Orodruin, he secretly forged the One Ring.  This was to be the first stroke in his conquest of the west - a device by which he could know, and control, the thoughts of the bearers of the other Rings.  His plan failed, though: the Elves became aware of his malevolent presence, and took off their Rings.Angered by this setback, Sauron loosed the hordes of Mordor, six hundred years in the building, and overran Eriador, destroying the land of Eregion where the Rings were made.  The Elves called on N&#250;menor for aid, though, and the army of Tar-Minastir put Sauron's forces to rout. After this reverse, Sauron sought instead to build power in the eastern countries, and left the Westlands in peace for many centuries.When Ar-Pharaz&#244;n usurped the throne of N&#250;menor in 3255 (Second Age), he saw Sauron's growing eastern kingdom as a threat.  Building and equipping a mighty fleet, he sailed for Middle-earth, and landed at Umbar, to the south of the Mouths of Anduin.  Ar-Pharaz&#244;n demanded that Sauron submit to his authority and, seeing that the might of the N&#250;men&#243;reans far outstripped his own, Sauron agreed.The Shapes of SauronAll of the Ainur had the ability to change their form, but none held so many different shapes as Sauron.  During the First Age, his accustomed form seems to have been that of a dark sorceror, commanding a host of evil things, and especially werewolves and their kind. He shifted form many times in his existence, though, especially during his duel with Huan; among the shapes he wore were:&#149;Wolf-Sauron.  This was the monstrous wolf-shape he chose when he went forth from his fortress on Tol-in-Gaurhoth to battle with Huan.&#149;During the battle, he changed his form to that of a serpent in his struggles to escape.&#149;Finally, after Huan released him, he became a great vampire, and fled into the east, 'dripping blood from his throat upon the trees'3.
	Notes
	1
	This is the meaning given by Christopher Tolkien, and must be considered canonical. However, the '-on' ending in this name presents an alternative interpretation.  This is a genitive ending ('of', in other words), and where it appears in other names, it often indicates lordship or ownership.  For example, Tauron (a name of Orom&#235;) means '(Lord) of the Forest'.  'Sauron', then, could be translated '(Lord) of Abomination'.
	2
	It is very noticeable that there is no mention of Sauron taking part in the War of Wrath. After the loss of his Isle, he fled to Dorthonion: the next we hear of him is then after the War, when he parleys with E&#246;nw&#235;, the captain of the Valar's forces.  The simple fact that Sauron survived Morgoth's obliteration is very telling, and strongly suggests that he must not have taken an active part himself.This is consistent with what we know of Sauron's character - he always prefers to work from behind the scenes, manipulating events to his favour.  On the rare occasions where he goes into battle himself, he is always defeated.  This perhaps helps to explain his decision in the later Second Age not to offer battle to the armies of N&#250;menor.Sauron's desire to work from the shadows is most strongly represented in The Lord of the Rings itself: although he gives his name to that book, and is of pivotal importance to the plot, he never makes a physical appearance.
	3
	This quote comes from The Silmarillion, 19 Of Beren and L&#250;thien, and hints at a peculiar characteristic of the Ainur's shape-changing abilities.  Injuries sustained in one form - in this case wounds from the battle with Huan - seem to persist to other forms.  We see this again in The Lord of the Rings; Gollum says (in IV 3 The Black Gate is Closed) 'He has only four [fingers] on the Black Hand'. This is a reference to Isildur's cutting the Ring from his hand at the end of the Second Age, but Gollum is speaking at the end of the Third.  Though Sauron had built himself a new form since his defeat, he could not, it seems, recreate his lost finger.

	One of the greatest of the dragons to infest the Grey Mountains of the north.  Of his life little is known, except that he was slain by Fram son of Frumgar (an ancestor of Eorl the Young) in the early days of the &#201;oth&#233;od.His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the Men of the &#201;oth&#233;od and the Dwarves of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own.  Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, &quot;Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by.&quot;2 Thereafter there was war between the &#201;oth&#233;od and the Dwarves, a war in which Fram met his end.However this dispute was resolved (we are not told), it seems that Fram's people retained at least some of the hoard, and brought it south with them when they settled in Rohan.  The horn that &#201;owyn gave to Merry Brandybuck after the War of the Ring (many hundred years later) was said to have come from it.

	In fact sceatha is Old English, and survives in modern usage; the words 'scathing' and 'unscathed' both derive from it.

Among the early Kings, it was normal to voluntarily surrender the Sceptre to an Heir, but this tradition was abandoned in later years.  Ar-Pharaz&#244;n carried the Sceptre with him when he sailed to attack Blessed Realm, and it was lost with the King and all his armies.  In Middle-earth, the exiled N&#250;men&#243;reans maintained this tradition, and their High King held the Sceptre of Ann&#250;minas, which had been the symbol of the Lords of And&#250;ni&#235; in N&#250;menor.

	A scroll made by Isildur himself during his short time in Minas Tirith after the War of the Last Alliance, that was stored for millennia in the vaults of that city.  The scroll held Isildur's account of the gaining of the Ring from Sauron. His description of the Ring, and his account of the fiery writing that ran around it, was vital in helping Gandalf identify Frodo's Magic Ring as the One Ring of Sauron.

	The Seal of the Stewards, reconstructed from Tolkien's description.The seal of the Stewards of Gondor, consisting of the letters R&#183;ND1&#183;R below three stars. The letters represent the word Arandur.  This is the actual Elvish title, literally meaning 'King's Servant', that Tolkien renders into English as 'Steward'.When the twelfth Steward, Cirion, sent north to Eorl for aid in his desperate wars, he sent the Seal with each of six riders.  Only one of these, named Borondir, succeeded in reaching the nation of the &#201;oth&#233;od, but from this came the famous Ride of Eorl and the foundation of Rohan.

	To the Elves, 'ND' was a single character of the tengwar known as ando (the character that looks a little like a doubled 'p' in the example above).

Second Age
	[secondage.txt]
	The Age of N&#250;menor
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	II 1 to II 3441
	Beginning in about the 584th year since the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Second Age is the longest of the chronicled Ages.  It began after the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, the founding of Lindon and the creation of N&#250;menor.The Second Age was the Age of N&#250;menor; the great island kingdom was created and peopled by the descendants of the Edain in the first years of the Age, and as the years passed, their power grew until it surpassed that of any nation of Men, before or since.  They sailed east, exploring Middle-earth and founding great cities there.  Eventually, their power and pride became so great that they challenged the Valar themselves, and were destroyed.The end of N&#250;menor was not the end of the Second Age, though; a remnant of the N&#250;menoreans led by Elendil escaped its wreck and founded kingdoms in Middle-earth: Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south.  They formed a mighty alliance, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and marched on Sauron, who had grown great again, assailing the Dark Tower of Barad-d&#251;r.  With the first overthrow of Sauron by the Alliance, the Second Age came to its end.Key Events of the Second Age1Foundation of the Elven-kingdoms in the west of Middle-earth, Mithlond and Lindon.32Arrival of the Edain in N&#250;menor.

Seeing-stones
	[seeingstones.txt]
	A name for the Palant&#237;ri
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Made during the Years of the Trees.  At least two1 survived into the Fourth Age
	Origins:
	Made by F&#235;anor
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Palant&#237;ri, Seven Stones, Stones of Seeing
	The powerful orbs known as the palant&#237;ri made in ancient days by the Elves in Aman, and indeed said to have been the work of F&#235;anor himself.  In appearance they were dark, perfectly smooth globes of various capabilities and sizes; some were small and portable, others so huge that they could not be lifted by a Man.The Elves gave certain of these stones to the N&#250;men&#243;reans, and seven of these N&#250;men&#243;rean stones were rescued from the Downfall of that island by Elendil and his sons.  So these seven were brought to Middle-earth, and the D&#250;nedain set them up at distant points in their lands: at Amon S&#251;l, Elostirion and Ann&#250;minas in the north, and at Osgiliath, Orthanc, Minas Anor and Minas Ithil in the south.  The chief stone of the north was that of Amon S&#251;l, lost with Arvedui in the cold northern seas.  The greatest of the southern stones stood beneath the Dome of Stars in Osgiliath, and was lost during the Kin-strife.During the Third Age, three of the stones were known to have been lost (Arvedui also had the Stone of Ann&#250;minas with him when he was lost at sea).  The Ithil-stone was captured by Sauron and almost certainly destroyed in the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r, and the palant&#237;r of Elostirion in the Tower Hills was taken back into the West on the Ring-bearers' White Ship. At the beginning of the Fourth Age, then, there were just two Seeing-stones left in Middle-earth, the Anor-stone and the Orthanc-stone.The Seeing-stones of Middle-earth were not the only palant&#237;ri to exist.  Many remained with the Elves in Aman, including the so-called Master-stone held in the Tower of Avall&#243;n&#235; on Tol Eress&#235;a.  Indeed, it was said that, before the stone was removed from the Tower Hills, it could be used to look along the Straight Road to the Undying Lands themselves.
	Notes
	1
	It is conceivable that a third Stone, the Ithil-stone,  also survived into the Fourth Age.  See the entry for Palant&#237;ri for a discussion on this point.

Fen of Serech
	[serech.txt]
	Scene of Barahir&#146;s rescue of Finrod
	Meaning:
	Possibly related to the Sindarin sereg, 'blood'
	Location:
	Northern Beleriand
	The Fen of Serech lay on the upper course of the mighty River Sirion, at the inflowing of its tributary, the Rivil.  Lying as it did at the mouth of one of the few passes in the northern mountains of Beleriand, the Fen played a part in many battles, and had a long and bloody history.This history started at the very beginning of the First Age, in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, which saw a great victory for the Elves over the forces of Morgoth.  As the remnant of the Orc armies fled back from the Falas, Celegorm rode down from the hills around Eithel Sirion and drove them into the waters of Serech.In 455 (First Age), at the Dagor Bragollach, Finrod Felagund found himself cut off in the Fen with a small host.  He seemed lost, but was rescued with great loss by Barahir and escaped back to Nargothrond.  This was the beginning of the great friendship between Finrod and the kin of Barahir, and Finrod gave Barahir his ring in token of this.The Elves' counter-attack, the battle that became the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, was made sixteen years later.  King Fingon drew up his battle-line along the upper course of the Sirion, between the Fen and the fortress of Barad Eithel.  It was here that the heralds of Morgoth tortured Gelmir before the Elven host, and Gwindor his brother broke ranks, driving into the Orc host seeking his revenge, and starting the great battle.Later, as the battle drew to a close, Turgon and the host of Gondolin were forced back across the Fen.  H&#250;rin and Huor, with the men of the House of Hador made a stand there on the banks of the Rivil, allowing Turgon to escape the ruin of the Elves and reach Gondolin. Huor and his men were slain one by one by the Orcs, but H&#250;rin slayed seventy of the enemy before being captured.After twenty-eight years of torture, Morgoth released H&#250;rin and set a watch upon him. H&#250;rin's first act was to seek out the hidden city of Gondolin, but Turgon was suspicious and ignored his cries; 'Turgon, Turgon, remember the Fen of Serech'.

Seregon
	[seregon.txt]
	The blood-red flower of Amon R&#251;dh
	A plant noted for its deep, blood-red flowers, from which it took its name: seregon means 'blood of stone'.  It was a plant of the same kind known today as 'stonecrop', which grows in low clumps on the face of rocks, and produces bright clusters of flowers.
	Seregon was famously the only plant found on the rocky head of Amon R&#251;dh: when it was in flower, the head of that hill appeared to be bathed in blood.  This proved to be ominous, because it was here that T&#250;rin's outlaw band were betrayed to the Orcs by M&#238;m, and their blood ran among the red flowers of the seregon.

Seven Rivers of Ossir
	[sevenriversofossir.txt]
	The River Gelion and its six tributaries
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age
	Race:
	The lands west of the Blue Mountains, south of the Dwarf-road
	Sources:
	The Gelion itself rose from two streams, whose springs lay either side of the March of MaedhrosIts six tributaries all rose in the Blue Mountains
	Outflow:
	Into the Great Sea south of Taur-im-Duinath1
	Pronunciation:
	'Ossir' is pronounced o'sseer
	Meaning:
	'Ossir' is a shortened form of Ossiriand, 'Land of Seven Rivers'
	Seven rivers that flowed through Ossiriand, the land of the Green-elves west of the Blue Mountains.  The most important of these was the Gelion, which flowed from the March of Maedhros in the far north, and formed the western border of Ossiriand.The other six rivers were tributaries of this large river, each stemming from a separate spring in the Blue Mountains, and flowing westward to empty into the Gelion. The northernmost of these was the Ascar, which rose in the mountains near Nogrod, and flowed beside the Dwarf-road to Sarn Athrad.  South from the Ascar were the Thalos, the Legolin, the Brilthor and the Duilwen.  Finally, the southernmost of the six was the River Adurant, in which the green island of Tol Galen stood.
	Notes
	1
	The mouths of the River Gelion don't appear on any known map - in all cases, the river flows off the map's southern edge in a most inconvenient fashion.  However, we know that the forest of Taur-im-Duinath grew between Sirion in the west and Gelion in the east, so logically Gelion must have flowed into the sea south of the forest.  In fact this is explicit in earlier versions of the Silmarillion: for example, in the Quenta Silmarillion reproduced in The History of Middle-earth volume 5 (The Lost Road), the forest is placed 'between the mouths of Sirion and Gelion' (our italics).  By contrast, later versions, including the published Silmarillion, describe it in less definite terms as just 'between Sirion and Gelion'.  It isn't clear whether this change holds any particular significance - just possibly, Tolkien may have intended Gelion's outflow to be further south, somewhat beyond the southern end of the forest.

	Notes
	1
	Tolkien never states explicitly that Shadowfax sailed into the West.  In his Letters, though, he gives such a wealth of clues and hints, we can state with near-certainty that the great horse sailed on the White Ship with his master Gandalf. (See The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 268, dated 1965).
	2
	Fax is an extinct word for 'hair' or 'coat', now only surviving in a few place- and family-names, like 'Fairfax'. In fact, Tolkien has anglicised the name 'Shadowfax' somewhat from its original form; in the Old English language representing the tongue of the Rohirrim who bred him, he would have been called Sceadufax or Scadufax.

In the War of the Last Alliance, Elendil fell, and his sword was broken, but its remains were brought to the North-kingdom.  These shards were carried by Elendil's heirs throughout the Third Age, as a token of their ancestry, until the time of the War of the Ring.  The shards were reforged by the smiths of Rivendell into Aragorn's sword And&#250;ril.

Shelob
	[shelob.txt]
	The great she-spider who haunted Cirith Ungol
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Uncertain.  Probably originated in the First Age1, and known to have survived into the Fourth
	Pronunciation:
	Presumably 'shee'lob'2
	Meaning:
	'She-spider' ('lob' is an old English word for 'spider')2
	Titles:
	The Great, Her Ladyship
	UngoliantSHELOBOthersSpidersof MirkwoodOthers
	A creature of spider-shape, of the spawn of Ungoliant, who dwelt in the mountains on the western borders of Mordor.
	Notes
	1
	The earliest definite date we have for Shelob is c.1000 (Second Age), because we know that she occupied Cirith Ungol 'before the first stone of Barad-d&#251;r' which was laid at about that time (from The Two Towers IV 9 Shelob's Lair).  We also know, from the same source, that she originally came there 'flying from ruin' - this is indefinite, but ties in neatly with the War of Wrath a thousand years earlier.  The suggestion here is that she originally occupied Beleriand, probably in the Ered Gorgoroth, and fled southwards to escape its destruction.
	2
	If 'Shelob' were an Elvish name, the 'e' sound would be short, giving a pronunciation something like 'shehlob'.  Her name, though, is a compound of two English words, 'She-lob', so we have assumed a standard English pronunciation.

The Shire

	The land of Hobbits west of the Brandywine
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Founded in III 1601 (year 1 by the Shire-reckoning), and expanded to include Buckland and the Westmarch in IV 41 (1452 by the Shire-reckoning)
	Location:
	Eriador in the northwest of Middle-earth
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Meaning:
	From Old English sc&#237;r, meaning a land granted as a fiefdom
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Land of the Halflings
	At the end of the Third Age, the Shire was the most populous country of the Hobbits in the north of Middle-earth.  It was founded in the middle of the Third Age by the Bree-hobbits Marcho and Blanco, and gifted to them and their followers by King Argeleb II of Arthedain, within whose borders the land lay at that time.The Shire was divided into four farthings, North, South, East and West; its chief town was at Michel Delving on the White Downs, in the Westfarthing.  The Mayor of Michel Delving was accounted among the most important of the Shire-hobbits, as was the Thain (the head of the Took family).The Shire was largely given over to agriculture, and its land was well-suited for farming. One of its chief products was Halflings' Leaf (tobacco), grown especially in the warmer regions of the Southfarthing.

	The system of reckoning dates unique to the Hobbits of the Shire, based on the founding of that land in III 1601.  The Shire-hobbits reckoned this as year 1.  So, years of the Third Age can be converted to Shire-years by subtracting 1600 (e.g. the Downfall of Barad-d&#251;r occurred in III 3019, but in the Shire this was counted as the year 1419).The Shire-folk took no account of the change of Age in III 3021.  While the other peoples of Middle-earth considered this to be the first year of the Fourth Age, in the Shire it was simply 1421.

	For nearly four hundred years after its foundation, the Shire had been part of the lands of Arthedain, and under the rule of that land's King.  Ultimately, Arthedain fell to the forces of Angmar, and its last King, Arvedui, was lost, leaving the Shire-hobbits without a ruler.  They remedied this by choosing a new leader from among themselves, Bucca of the Marish, who was given the title thain, a word simply meaning 'chief'.Bucca and his descendants, a family known as the Oldbucks, served as Shire-thain for twelve generations. The twelfth Thain, one Gorhendad Oldbuck, left the Shire and crossed the River Brandywine to found Buckland.  With his departure, the Thainship passed to a new line, the Tooks, and specifically to Isumbras Took I.From Isumbras I, the line of the Took Shire-thains continued unbroken to the time of the War of the Ring and beyond.  The last recorded Thain was Faramir Took I, the thirty-fourth to hold the title of Shire-thain.  The fact that both he and his father Peregrin Took are recorded as the first of that name shows that there must have been more Thains after this time, and the tradition clearly lasted well into the Fourth Age.

Silmarillion

	&#145;Of the Silmarils&#146;
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Constituent parts date back to the First Age and possibly even earlier.  Assembled into a complete narrative between III 3003 and III 3021
	Authors:
	Assembled from ancient works by various authors by Bilbo Baggins
	Meaning:
	The full title, Quenta Silmarillion, means 'Tale of the Silmarils'
	While Bilbo Baggins dwelt in Rivendell, he made use of all the resources there (including the memories of living Elves) to write four scholarly volumes bound in red leather.  The first of these, the Red Book of Westmarch, was continued by Bilbo's heir, Frodo.  It was copied many times, and became the original source for our modern The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.The Hobbits of the Shire, though, seem to have had less interest in the other three volumes, originally entitled simply Translations from the Elvish, that told the tales of the ancient First Age and the time before.  Only one copy was made, in Gondor in 172 (Fourth Age), and this was kept at Great Smials by the Took family - it became known as the Thain's Book. It is from this copy that the modern Silmarillion comes1.The Silmarillion, which in its own words passes 'from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin'2 actually consists of a corpus of five works, of which the Quenta Silmarillion is the central tale.  These are:Ainulindal&#235;, the tale of the Music of the Ainur and the creation of Arda.Valaquenta, the tale of the Valar, in which the nature of each of the Powers is described.Quenta Silmarillion, the longest tale, which gives an account of the history of Arda from its beginnings until the end of the First Age.Akallab&#234;th, the tale of the Second Age, which concentrates on the history of N&#250;menor until its Downfall.Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, which spans the late Second Age and the Third, telling of the forging of the Rings of Power and their history up to the War of the Ring.
	Notes
	1
	Within the context of Tolkien's tales, of course.  The Silmarillion was actually written and rewritten over a period of some sixty years by J.R.R. Tolkien, and edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher.

	Timeline:

	Other&nbsp;Names:
	The Great Jewels, Jewels of F&#235;anor
	The three great jewels made by F&#235;anor in Valinor, in which he locked the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, before their destruction.  Melkor stole the jewels from F&#235;anor's stronghold at Formenos, slaying his father Finw&#235;, and fled with them back to his fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.F&#235;anor swore an oath to recover the Silmarils, and many of the Noldor followed him into exile in pursuit of the jewels.  So began their hopeless war against the forces of Morgoth, of which the Quenta Silmarillion (the 'Tale of the Silmarils') tells the story.  During the First Age, one Silmaril alone was recovered from Morgoth's Iron Crown by Beren and L&#250;thien, and was borne by E&#228;rendil when he sailed into the West to seek the aid of the Valar.By virtue of the Silmaril, it is said, E&#228;rendil reached Aman and was heard by the Valar, who sent a mighty force into Middle-earth.  Morgoth was utterly defeated, and the Silmarils recovered.  Maedhros and Maglor, the only two of F&#235;anor's seven sons to survive until that War of Wrath, stole the jewels from the camp of the Valar.  Their evil deeds in pursuance of the jewels, however, drove them to madness; Maedhros cast himself into a fiery chasm with one of the Silmarils, and Maglor threw the other into the depths of the sea.  So only one Silmaril remains visible in the World, bound to E&#228;rendil's brow as he sails the heavens; the Morning and Evening Star.

Silvan Elves
	[silvanelves.txt]
	Elves who fell away from the Great Journey
	Dates:
	Originated during the Great Journey, some three ages before the rising of the Moon.  Still extant at the time of the War of the Ring.
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Teleri
	Meaning:
	'Silvan' is English, denoting 'Woodland'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Tawarwaith
	Long before the beginning of the First Age, the Elves of the Great Journey travelled westward through the lands of Middle-earth.  Coming to the Great River Anduin and the high peaks of the Misty Mountains, some of the Elves of the clan of the Teleri fell away from the journey, and settled in the woodlands east of the Mountains.  These were the original Silvan Elves, who lived on either side of the River.  At this time in their history, all of this people still lived close together, with some dwelling in the land that would later be called L&#243;rien, and the others settling around the hill of Amon Lanc in the far south of Greenwood the Great.
	It must have been in the time these Elves were living closely together that the Silvan Elvish language appeared. As history passed, the Elves would move away from one another, and mingle with other Elvish peoples, so that the Silvan branch of Elvish would eventually become extinct.  Nonetheless, relics of that ancient tongue survived in some well-known place-names and personal names, such as Caras Galadhon, Amroth and even L&#243;rien itself.The Silvan Elves dwelt in their twin woodland realms for many centuries, but in the Second Age the emerging power of Sauron began to drive them apart.  Oropher was the ruler of the Elves who dwelt in the Greenwood, and he began to seek safety by moving his people northwards, away from Amon Lanc and away from the Silvan Elves who lived to the west of the Great River.
	West of Anduin: the Silvan Elves of L&#243;rienUnlike their cousins in the east, the Silvan Elves of L&#243;rien remained settled in their land throughout their known history.  We know little of their existence well into the Second Age, where we find them ruled by a Sindarin Elf named Amd&#237;r2.  After the destruction of Eregion in the middle Second Age, many of its exiles had escaped through Khazad-d&#251;m into the east, and had joined the Silvan Elves of L&#243;rien and ultimately mingled with them.
	Amd&#237;r was lost in the wars at the end of the Second Age.  In the time of his son Amroth, Durin's Bane was unleashed in Khazad-d&#251;m.  After this time, especially with the power of Sauron growing in Dol Guldur to the east, many of L&#243;rien's people fled into the south.  Amroth himself was among them, and he was drowned in the Bay of Belfalas far from his kingdom.  It was at this time, a little more than a thousand years before the War of the Ring, that Galadriel and Celeborn became the Lord and Lady of L&#243;rien.East of Anduin: the Silvan Elves of MirkwoodThe Elves of Greenwood the Great, soon to become known as Mirkwood, had a much less settled existence than their fellow Silvan Elves in the west.  Their original dwellings were in the far south of the great Wood, but as Sauron's power grew, they gradually withdrew farther and farther northward.  Eventually Sauron chose to settle within the Forest itself, and in fact built his fortress of Dol Guldur on the hill of Amon Lanc, where the Silvan Elves had originally dwelt.  Though his identity remained secret during this time (he was known simply as the 'Necromancer') he brought darkness and shadow to Greenwood the Great, and the Elves retreated farther still.In the later years of the Third Age, their King Thranduil (the son of Oropher, who was slain in the War of the Last Alliance) dwelt with his people in the far northeast of Mirkwood, in underground dwellings protected by magic.  Their history of fleeing from Sauron's darkness had made them a suspicious and unwelcoming people, as Thorin and his companions discovered during the Quest of Erebor.  It was from Thranduil's underground halls that his son Legolas journeyed at the end of the Third Age, to play a great part in the War of the Ring.The War of the Ring and beyondIn the War of the Ring, Sauron's forces attacked both Silvan realms.  By the power of Galadriel and her Ring, L&#243;rien was protected against three waves of assault from Dol Guldur.  Thranduil had no Ring to protect his realm  - it was invaded and the trees of the northern forest set alight, though he was at last able to drive back the enemy.With the fall of Sauron, Dol Guldur was destroyed, and Mirkwood renamed again: Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves. Now the Silvan Elves once again dwelt in the south of the Wood, but these were not Thranduil's people, but Elves of L&#243;rien, who crossed the Great River to live in a new land named East L&#243;rien.  Though the original land of L&#243;rien faded after the passing of Galadriel and Celeborn, the Silvan Elves of the Wood lived peacefully under their trees for many long years.
	Notes
	1
	The same root is found in place names such as Pennsylvania ('Penn's wooded land') or Transylvania ('Land across (or beyond) the Forest').
	2
	Actually, we should say the first known ruler of the Silvan Elves in L&#243;rien was probably Amd&#237;r.  The sources are inconsistent on this point, and in one case the ruler seems to be named 'Malgalad'.

	&nbsp;&#149; Silvan Elves
	On the Great Journey of the Elves into the West, a part of the Elf-kin known as the Teleri broke away, and settled in the wooded lands east of the Misty Mountains.  The language they spoke was an early form of Elvish, from which developed dialects known as Silvan Elvish, used both in L&#243;rien and the Woodland Realm of Mirkwood.
	The cousins of these Silvan Elves were the Sindar, also of Telerin origin, who settled far to the west in Beleriand, and whose speech evolved into Sindarin, which would become the main Elf-tongue of Middle-earth.  After the First Age, the surviving Elves of Beleriand carried their speech back into the east.  Sindarin-speakers settled in both the main Silvan realms, and in L&#243;rien, at least, Sindarin quickly overtook Silvan Elvish in common use.  The history of the tongue in Mirkwood is more difficult to determine - some sources suggest that it, too, was quickly overtaken by Sindarin, but other sources dispute this.
	Whatever the historical situation in Mirkwood, Silvan Elvish was eventually overcome by the Sindarin speech, so that by the end of the Third Age, its only remnants were a few names, like Caras Galadhon or Amroth, that betray the influences of Silvan words.  Those names aside, Silvan Elvish seems to have fallen completely out of use.

Sindar
	[sindar.txt]
	The Grey-elves
	Race:
	Elves
	Meaning:
	'Grey People' (from the name of their King, Thingol Greycloak)
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Edhel, Elves of the Twilight, Grey-elves
	Pronunciation:
	see'ndarr(note that the final 'r' sound should be pronounced - 'rr' is used here to emphasise this)
	Note:
	'Sindar' is a plural term; the singular form is never used in Tolkien's published work, but is almost certainly 'Sinda'; the adjective for these people is 'Sindarin'.
	An Elvish people of Telerin origin.  Coming to the western shores of Middle-earth with the others of their kin, they did not pass across the sea, but remained in Beleriand.  Some had tarried there searching for their lord, Elw&#235;, while others were persuaded to remain by Oss&#235; the Maia.Before the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Sindar were found in most parts of Beleriand; all claimed Elw&#235; (known as Thingol in the Sindarin tongue) as their high king.  There were two main countries of the Sindar, however; in Doriath under the rule of Thingol and Melian, and in the Falas, under the lordship of C&#237;rdan the Shipwright.Before the Return of the NoldorFor two ages, the Sindar dwelt in peace and plenty; they roamed throughout Beleriand, from the shorelands of the Falas in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and all owned Thingol as their lord and king.In the third age of the Captivity of Melkor (that is, the last age of the Years of the Trees), evil things that had dwelt east of the Blue Mountains began to trouble the Sindar.  At this time, they first considered the need for weapons and armour, which they had not needed before. They traded with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost, and learned smithcraft from them. Thus armed, they drove the invading wolves and Orcs and other foul things from their land and had peace again, for a time.

	Race:

	Grey-elven
	Meaning:
	'(Language) of the Grey People'
	The language of the Grey-elves of Beleriand and most commonly used of the Elf-tongues in Middle-earth.  When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, Thingol decreed that their tongue, Quenya, was not to be spoken in his realms.  So the language of his people, Sindarin, came to dominate.  Quenya, though, was still used as a language of ceremony and poetry.Sindarin shared common roots with Quenya, and the two languages had many similar words. Sindarin was said to be more changeful than the older tongue, however, and there were a number of regional 'dialects' of the tongue.  The Sindarin spoken in Doriath was said to be the highest and most noble form of the language.

The Sirion was regarded as the border between East and West Beleriand.

	Smaug's description of himselffrom The Hobbit 12 Inside Information
	Smaug was the last of the great fire-drakes, and said to be the greatest dragon of his time. At some time during the twenty-eighth century of the Third Age, he came to hear of the immense wealth held by the Dwarves of Erebor.  Where he came from we do not know for certain, but in the year III 2770 he descended in fire on the Lonely Mountain, destroying the Dwarf-kingdom and the nearby township of Dale.Gathering together the treasures of the Dwarves, he formed himself an immense bed of gold and jewels and settled within the ruined halls of Erebor.  Slowly the years and decades passed, until the people of the Long Lake to the south had almost forgotten the Dragon of Erebor and Smaug imagined himself unassailable.Then, one day in the October of III 2941, one hundred and seventy-one years after his arrival in Erebor, Smaug awoke to find his treasure disturbed. Of all that mountain of wealth, he noticed with rage that a single two-handled cup had been taken.  He could not have imagined that the loss of that cup signalled his own imminent downfall; Thorin, the heir of the King under the Mountain that Smaug had driven from his halls those many years before, had returned to reclaim his kingdom.  With him came Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit with a magical Ring with which he had invisibly removed that single cup from Smaug's treasure.In his anger, the dragon flew from his halls, scorching and breaking the mountainside.  Thorin, Bilbo and their companions were sealed in a hidden tunnel, and at last the frustrated Smaug gave up his attack on the mountain.  Realizing that they must have had help from Lake-town to the south, he set out to punish the Men of the Lake instead.That was to be Smaug's last flight.  Bilbo had managed to discover an open patch in the dragon's armour, and word of this had been carried to Lake-town. In particular, it reached the heir of another of Smaug's victims, Bard, the descendant of Girion of Dale.  Bard shot Smaug with an arrow, and though Lake-town was devastated in his attack and fall, the dragon was defeated.  In years to come, beneath the waters of the lake his mighty bones could be seen, and the jewels that had lined his hide: the last remains of the greatest dragon of his age.
	Notes
	1
	This peculiar derivation is explained in a letter by J.R.R. Tolkien written in 1938: &quot;The dragon bears as a name - a pseudonym - the past tense of the primitive Germanic verb Smugan, to squeeze through a hole: a low philological jest.&quot;

He was eventually exiled by his people, and crept into the roots of the Misty Mountains, where he became the creature of the dark better known as Gollum.
	Notes

	Sm&#233;agol's date of birth is nowhere given explicitly.  The date of III 2440 is an estimate based on his acquiring the Ring in about III 2463, when he was evidently still quite young and childish, in hobbit terms.

	This is based on the assumption that all trolls appeared at roughly the same time.  We know that trolls in general seem to date back to the First Age or before, though it can't be stated with certainty that snow-trolls weren't a more recent development (a result of Sauron's breeding programmes, for example).

They held lands in East Beleriand, with Maedhros and Maglor holding the immediate passes south of Lothlann, and the other brothers ruling lands behind their guard to the south.F&#235;anor's sons were in general allied with the other Elves of Beleriand against the power of Morgoth.  After the recovery of one of the Great Jewels by Beren and L&#250;thien, however, the Oath of their father came into action, and they fell upon the other Elves in hope of retrieving the Silmaril.  They attacked Dior in Doriath, and the Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion, but neither of these forays gained them the Jewel; it was borne into the West by E&#228;rendil.At the time of the War of Wrath, only two of the seven sons remained; Maedhros and Maglor.  They stole the last two Silmarils from the camp of E&#246;nw&#235;, but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the hallowed Jewels rejected their claimants.  Maedhros in anguish threw himself into a fiery fissure, and Maglor in despair cast his Jewel into the Great Sea.

	Notes
	1
	The only specific mention of the Shire's southern point (and hence the southern borders of the Southfarthing) is in the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings, where we're told that the whole Shire stretched '...fifty [leagues] from the northern moors to the marshes in the south.'  There is no specific mention of Sarn Ford here, but there are good reasons for thinking that it marked the boundary.  We know, for example, that the Rangers who guarded the borders of the Shire maintained a post there.Even more telling is the story of the final departure Merry and Pippin from the Shire, long after the War of the Ring in IV 63.  In Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, we're told that they '...handed over their goods and offices to their sons and rode away over the Sarn Ford, and they were not seen again in the Shire.'  It seems very likely from this that Sarn Ford marked the Southfarthing's southern boundary.

Spiders
	[spiders.txt]
	Eight-legged spinners of webs
	Species:
	Many species of the order Araneae1
	Meaning:
	From the Old English word spi&#240;ra, ultimately coming from spinnan, meaning 'spin'
	Other&nbsp;names:
	Bilbo uses several old words for a 'spider' in The Hobbit, including attercop2, cob3 and lob4
	&quot;Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.&quot;
	Words of GandalfThe Fellowship of the Ring II 2 The Council of Elrond
	These small eight-legged creatures, known for capturing their prey in intricate webs, were evidently as common in Middle-earth as they are today.  Characters in The Lord of the Rings often refer to them descriptively, whether it be Gandalf discussing his capture by Saruman (quoted above), Sam climbing ropes across the Silverlode, or Gollum clambering down a rock wall.There was a more sinister side to the spiders of Middle-earth, though, that entered it with the monstrous Ungoliant in the years before the First Age.  A gigantic creature of spider-shape, it was she who destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, and escaped with Melkor into the lands of Middle-earth.  Though Ungoliant herself disappeared into the far south, she left the northern lands infested with her offspring.  During the First Age, the mountains of the Ered Gorgoroth were infested with these monsters, and became a place of dread.The most famous of Ungoliant's children, though, lived far to the south and east of the Ered Gorgoroth, on the borders of the land of Mordor.  This was Shelob, who haunted a network of tunnels watching the pass of Cirith Ungol, eking a living on the hapless Orcs of Sauron.  She had offspring of her own, too, smaller than she but with a cruel intelligence, that spread throughout the Ephel D&#250;ath and north into Mirkwood.  It was creatures like these that Bilbo encountered in The Hobbit, and through fighting them that his sword acquired its name Sting.
	Notes
	1
	There are about twenty thousand different species of spider in the modern world, so presumably there was a similar variety in Middle-earth, too.  Most of those described by Tolkien, though, had a supernatural element to their make-up.
	2
	Attercop literally means 'poison-head', and was actually a word used for a variety of poisonous creatures - from atter, we also derive our modern word adder, a type of poisonous snake.
	3
	Cob is probably a shortened version of attercop, and survives to modern times in the word cobweb.
	4
	Lob most famously appears in Shelob, the name of the great female spider that haunted the mountain borders of Mordor.

Sam secretly gave names to these two sides of Sm&#233;agol: the pathetic, simpering side he called 'Slinker', but the jealous, dangerous side he gave an even worse name: Stinker.  As Gollum's darker side took him over completely, so Sam started to use the name 'Stinker' as just another name for the scheming creature.

During a storm, the Stone-giants emerge, and cast huge boulders about a rocky valley as part of a bizarre game.The difficulty of fitting Stone-giants (and all giants, for that matter) into Tolkien's world has led some to see the Stone-giants as a metaphor for crashing thunderbolts, or something similar.  However, the detail of the Stone-giants' description, and the occurrence of other giants in Tolkien's work, makes it seem likely that these creatures actually did exist in Middle-earth.

	One of the three palant&#237;ri of Arnor, the North-kingdom of the D&#250;nedain.

With these and other heirlooms, he fled into the far north, where he was given shelter by the Lossoth, the Snowmen of the north.

Stone of Erech
	[stoneoferech.txt]
	The great stone of the Blackroot Vale
	&quot;...for the hour is come for the oathbreakers:at the Stone of Erech they shall stand again...&quot;
	From the prophecy of Malbeth the SeerThe Return of the King V 2, The Passing of the Grey Company
	A great black stone, spherical in shape and roughly six feet in diameter.  It was half-buried at the top of the Hill of Erech at the mouth of the Blackroot Vale, far to the west of Minas Tirth.  The Stone was a mysterious and eerie place, shunned by the people of the valley, who claimed it had fallen from the sky, and was haunted by restless spirits.  In fact, the Stone had its origins in N&#250;menor, and was brought to Erech after the Downfall by Isildur himself.
	It was at the Stone of Erech that the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to Isildur's cause in the time of the Last Alliance.  When war came, though, he failed to fulfil his oath, and Isildur cursed the King and his people to wander the hills until they made good their promise.  After waiting through the long years of the Third Age, their chance came at last when Aragorn Elessar led them out from beneath the Dwimorberg to the Stone of Erech.  There at last they fulfilled their ancient bond, and marched to the aid of Gondor.

Stone of Orthanc
	[stoneoforthanc.txt]
	Saruman&#146;s palant&#237;r
	One of the seven palant&#237;ri brought to Middle-earth by Elendil and his sons at the end of the Second Age.  The Exiles of N&#250;menor built the Tower of Orthanc on what were then the northern borders of the realm of Gondor, and set the Seeing-stone in that unbreachable fortress.  As the Third Age wore on, the line of Kings came to an end, and the Rohirrim came to dwell in the lands south of Orthanc, so that in the last years of the Age, the remote Stone of Orthanc was all but forgotten by the Stewards of Gondor.  The Wizard Saruman had not forgotten the Stone, though, and when he took over the stewardship of Orthanc a great part of his reason was the hope that the Stone would still be held there.
	Saruman was not to be disappointed.  When he unlocked the impregnable Tower he found the Stone waiting inside, as it had for thousands of years.  In using it, it seems that Saruman had not taken account of the other palant&#237;ri in Middle-earth, for the lost Ithil-stone had fallen into the hands of Sauron, and Sauron used its power to bend the Stone of Orthanc to his own will, and with it Saruman himself.
	After Saruman's great reverses in the War of the Ring, he lost the Stone in a most peculiar way.  While he parleyed with Gandalf from the Tower, his servant Gr&#237;ma - not realizing the nature of the Stone - cast it at their enemies below, unwittingly granting them a great gift.  The Stone of Orthanc was used twice after it was thrown from the Tower, and each time the user encountered the Dark Lord himself.  Pippin's use of the Stone was a foolish mistake.  The second time, though, Aragorn knowingly used the palant&#237;r to reveal his ancestry to Sauron, and his sword And&#250;ril,  reforged from the sword that had cut the Ring from Sauron's finger some three thousand years before.  Thus he drew Sauron into open war, and distracted Sauron's Eye away from his own land of Mordor, so giving Frodo and Sam a chance to reach Mount Doom.

While most of the palant&#237;ri were small and portable, the Stone of Osgiliath was much larger, and could not be lifted by a Man.The greatest of the Seeing-stones was also the first to be lost.  During the early reign of Eldacar, a rebellion arose that came to be known as the Kin-strife.  During this civil war, the city of Osgiliath was besieged and burned by the rebels, and the Stone was lost in the waters of the River Anduin.

	Race:
	Trolls
	Meaning:
	'Troll' is a word from Scandinavian myth, used as an English translation of the Sindarin torog, of uncertain derivation
	'Stone' presumably comes from the fact that these creatures turned to stone under the light of the Sun
	A race of trolls in the service of Sauron.  We know nothing for certain of these creatures except that they inhabited the Westlands of Middle-earth: the trolls encountered by Bilbo Baggins and his companions on their journey to Erebor were likely of this kind.
	Notes
	1
	Actually, the three trolls encountered by Bilbo and company are never explicitly identified as 'Stone-trolls', but the circumstantial evidence for this quite strong.  Quite apart from the fact that they actually turned to stone, Tolkien mentions that '...in the Westlands the Stone-trolls spoke a debased form of the Common Speech' (The Lord of the Rings Appendix F 1), a comment that matches Bert, Bill and Tom well, but is hard to explain in any other terms.

	Straight Way
	Before the Downfall of N&#250;menor, the realm of the Gods in Valinor was still present in the world, and those Elves who wished to reach it could do so by sailing on into the West.  After the Downfall, Valinor was taken away, and the World took on the round shape we know today.  Mortals sailing into the West simply circled the globe and eventually returned to their starting place.For the Elves, however, a way was left open to return to Valinor; the Straight Road.  An elven-ship sailing into the West left the Bent World, and travelled through the air 'as it were on a mighty bridge invisible'1, until they came to Tol Eress&#235;a and the Undying Lands.The Straight Road was not entirely closed to Mortals; some by the special grace of the Valar could use it, as did the ring-bearers at the end of the Third Age.  Other mortal mariners too, it was said, would sometimes find the Road and come to the shores of Aman before they died.
	It is not certain whether the Straight Road could be traversed in both directions (i.e. whether Elves of Valinor could return to Middle-earth).  There are suggestions in Tolkien's unpublished writing that this may have been the case (though this is also contradicted by his later letters).  It is suggested, for example, that Glorfindel of Rivendell, who appears in The Lord of the Rings, may have been the same Glorfindel who was slain in the Fall of Gondolin in The Silmarillion, returned from the halls of Mandos.  We do know that the Wizards travelled eastward from Aman to Middle-earth, so at least eastward travel was possible, if only for the special emissaries of the Valar.

Though he was good for mountain riding, he was too small and slow to accompany the main army of Rohan across the plains from Edoras, and it was Th&#233;oden's purpose to leave Stybba and his rider behind at this point.  Merry found a way to complete the journey in secret with a Rider named Dernhelm (who was in fact &#201;owyn in disguise) but we hear no more of Stybba after Merry rode away from him at Edoras.

Sun
	[sun.txt]
	Laurelin&#146;s last fruit
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	First rose at the beginning of the First Age
	Location:
	The lower regions of Ilmen
	Origins:
	Mounted in a vessel by Aul&#235;, and set aloft by Varda
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Anar, Anor, V&#225;sa
	Titles:
	The Daystar, The Heart of Fire, The Yellow Face
	After the Darkening of Valinor, with the aid of Yavanna and Nienna, the dying Trees of the Valar produced a last single flower, and a last single fruit. Of these, the fruit was borne by Laurelin, the Golden Tree.  Filled with radiant fire, it was hallowed by Manw&#235;, and set in a vessel made by Aul&#235; and his people.  To pilot the vessel, the Valar chose a fire-spirit of the Maiar: the maiden known as Arien, who took on the form of a naked flame before guiding the newly made Sun aloft.
	The sun-maiden guided her charge into the skies above Valinor beyond the Western Sea, and so the first sunrise was in the West, not the east as it is today.  In Middle-earth, the Elves had dwelt in darkness beneath the stars since Melkor destroyed the Lamps of the Valar long ages before.  Now at last the Hither Lands were filled with brilliant light, bringing new life to the lands, and new hope to the Elves.  As the Sun rose in the West, the first Men awoke in the eastern lands of Middle-earth, and the first thing they saw was the shining new light.  Many of them followed the light across the Earth towards the western lands, and some eventually found their way into Beleriand to become the fathers of the Edain.  Because of the time of their awakening, Men were known to the Elves as the Children of the Sun.
	While Middle-earth stirred under the new light, Melkor was dismayed by it, and for a while his power was checked.  Even in the Third Age, most of the Orcs could not venture abroad in sunlight, and it was even powerful enough to turn trolls to stone, though eventually both Sauron and Saruman found ways to overcome this.
	After the first sunrise in the West, Varda had planned for the Sun, and its companion the Moon, to remain forever in a nightless sky.  She was persuaded against this by L&#243;rien and Est&#235;, and at last called the Sun back into Valinor: for those east of the Great Sea, this was the first sunset.  From that time onward, the Sun descended each evening into the depths of the Outer Sea, and passed beneath the World, to rise again in the eastern sky as she does to this day.

Sword of Elendil
	[swordofelendil.txt]
	The great sword known as Narsil
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Probably forged some time in the First Age1Broken in II 34412
	Origins:
	Forged by Telchar of Nogrod
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Narsil; after its reforging it was named And&#250;ril
	Narsil, the sword manufactured in ancient times by Telchar of Nogrod, and borne in the late Second Age by Elendil.  He fought with it in the War of the Last Alliance, where it was broken in his fall, but its Shards were preserved in the North-kingdom.
	Notes
	1
	Details of the original forging of Elendil's sword are difficult to determine.  It was made by Telchar of Nogrod, who also made the Dragon-helm of Dor-l&#243;min.  Helpfully, a passage in Unfinished Tales tells us that the Dragon-helm was originally made for Azagh&#226;l of Belegost, who died in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in I 471; in order to make the helm specifically for Azagh&#226;l, Telchar must have been working at about this time.  Though we can't be certain of Narsil's origins, then, we can fairly safely place its forging in Telchar's workshop in Nogrod, probably during the fourth or fifth centuries of the First Age.
	2
	The Sword was broken in the War of the Last Alliance, with the fall of Elendil.  Its burning light was lost, but Elendil's son Isildur used its broken shards to cut the Ruling Ring from Sauron's finger. The shards were eventually brought to Imladris, and they became an heirloom of the House of Isildur.  During the War of the Ring, the sword was reforged, its light was rekindled, and it was borne by Elendil's distant descendant Aragorn, who renamed it And&#250;ril.

	Fourteenth King of N&#250;menor

	'Tar' signifies 'King'.  'Ancalimon' is almost certainly 'Bright (One)' or possibly 'Great Brightness'2
	Tar-AtanamirTAR-ANCALIMONTar-Telemmait&#235;
	In the time of Tar-Ancalimon's father Tar-Atanamir, and of his grandfather Tar-Ciryatan, the N&#250;men&#243;reans had begun to turn against the Valar and the Eldar, and take pride in their own strength and wealth.  Tar-Ancalimon continued down this path, and the histories of N&#250;menor record that the division of the N&#250;men&#243;reans began in earnest during his reign.Politically, the realm became split between two parties, the King's Men, who followed Tar-Ancalimon's policies, and the Elendili, who favoured continued friendship with the Eldar. For the next millennium, N&#250;menor's history was bound up with the dissent between these two parties, and ultimately the King's Men were to help bring about its destruction.That lay in the far future, though: during his reign, Tar-Ancalimon turned away from the traditions of the past.  He discontinued the dedication to Eru, which had taken place at the Meneltarma in the middle of the island.  The tradition of the taking of the Kings' names in Elvish he maintained, though, partly through fear of ill-fortune.  This is perhaps because of a dark omen of Tar-Ancalimon's reign: the Eagles of Manw&#235;, who had nested in the tower of the King's palace at Armenelos since N&#250;menor's founding, left their eyrie and never returned.Tar-Ancalimon died as he had lived, clinging to the last vestiges of life as his father had before him.  He was succeeded by his son Tar-Telemmait&#235;, a man greedy for riches and silver, who followed in all the ways of his father.

The detailed account of The Line of Elros (in Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth) gives a definite accession date of II 2221, while the original form of the Tale of Years for the Second Age (in The Peoples of Middle-earth) includes an entry '2060-2251 Reign of Tar-Atanamir...' (Tar-Ancalimon's father).To complicate matters yet further, the Tale of Years that appears in The Lord of the Rings gives '2251 Tar-Atanamir takes the Sceptre'.  This is in significant conflict with all other sources.  If we follow The Line of Elros, for example, which is exact in almost all other details, then Tar-Atanamir became King thirty years after his own death!  Christopher Tolkien suggests that this Tale of Years entry must be an error, and his conclusion does seem unavoidable.

	'Bright' is here meant in the sense 'radiant', 'brilliant'.  Compare the famous Elvish phrase Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima (for example, from The Two Towers IV 9, Shelob's Lair), which can be translated 'Behold E&#228;rendil, brightest of stars'.

There is some confusion over his successor. The Lord of the Rings lists the King following Tar-Calmacil as Ar-Ad&#251;nakh&#244;r, but this may be due to an accidental omission, as evidence exists that Tar-Calmacil was in fact succeeded by his son Tar-Ardamin, and that Ar-Ad&#251;nakh&#244;r was actually his grandson.

	Titles:
	King of Gondor
	OstoherTAROSTAR(R&#243;mendacil&nbsp;I)Turambar
	A Man of Gondor, born into its Royal House in the time his great-grandfather E&#228;rendil ruled as King. He lived through the reigns of his grandfather Anardil and his father Ostoher before becoming King of Gondor himself.Two years before his succession, Gondor was suddenly beset by Wild Men out of the East, and Tarostar went to war in place of his father, who was in the last days of his old age.  Tarostar's war with the Easterlings was a hard one, lasting for ten years, and seeing the death of Ostoher and Tarostar's own succession to Gondor's throne.  At last, the Easterlings were driven back, and Tarostar took a new name, R&#243;mendacil, 'East-victor', under which to rule the South-kingdom.Decades later, the Easterlings renewed their attacks on Gondor.  Once again, Tarostar rode out to meet them, but the name of 'East-victor' did him no good - he was slain in the assault and his reign came to an end.  It fell to his son Turambar to take up the challenge; he avenged his father by driving back the Easterlings once again and claiming much land east of Anduin for Gondor.The events of Tarostar's life were strangely mirrored some seven centuries after his time.  Another great Gondorian, Minalcar, took charge of Gondor's armies in place of its King, and like Tarostar he led them to victory in the east.  Following Tarostar's example, he too took the name R&#243;mendacil, and would one day rule as R&#243;mendacil II.
	Notes
	1
	The date of Tarostar's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable.
	2
	The tar- element of Tarostar's name is definitely a reference to his royal status, but ostar is obscure.  It seems to relate to the root-word os-, 'surround', so it might mean 'protector' or it might be a plural, 'cities, fortresses' (literally, places surrounded by walls). Tarostar, then, might be 'royal protector', or it might be something like 'lord of the cities' (or, of course, some third possibility we haven't considered here).

He had no sons, and when he gave up the Sceptre his daughter Tar-Telperi&#235;n became the second Ruling Queen.

During her rule in N&#250;menor, momentous events were taking place in Middle-earth; the Rings of Power were forged, and Sauron's armies swept through Eriador.  It was left to Tar-Telperi&#235;n's successor, Tar-Minastir, to react to these events.Tar-Telperi&#235;n ruled N&#250;menor for one hundred and seventy-five years, and was succeeded by her nephew, the son of her younger brother Isilmo, who ruled as Tar-Minastir.

	At the beginning of the second millennium of the Third Age, a mysterious being came to Amon Lanc in the south of Greenwood the Great, and there built the stronghold known as Dol Guldur.  This was the magician known as the Necromancer, who was later revealed to be none other than Sauron himself, and from his fortress tower a shadow of nightshade began to spread across the woodlands.  From that time on, the Elves came to refer to the Greenwood as Taur-nu-Fuin, the forest under nightshade, rendered into the Mannish tongue as 'Mirkwood'.
	The story of Sauron's darkening of Greenwood the Great mirrors events in the First Age, when he occupied the highland forests of Dorthonion, north of Beleriand.  That region, too, fell under his shadow, and was also known as Taur-nu-Fuin.

	Race:

	Culture:

	Family:

	Meaning:
	Apparently 'silver fire'2
	Titles:
	King of Gondor
	MinardilTELEMNARMinastan(unnamed&nbsp;children)Tarondor
	Telemnar's Kingship was one of Gondor's shortest and most tragic.  He succeeded to the throne after his father Minardil was brutally slain in a sudden Corsair attack on Pelargir, but he was not to reign for long.  After just two years on the throne, the Great Plague came out of the east and ravaged Gondor.  Telemnar and all his children died of the sickness; he was succeeded by his nephew, Tarondor.
	Notes
	1
	The date of Telemnar's birth appears only in The History of Middle-earth volume XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth.  It cannot therefore be considered completely reliable.
	2
	Though Tolkien never interprets the name Telemnar directly, we know that the element telem in the name of his ancestor Tar-Telemmait&#235; means 'silver', and nar is known to be 'fire', so the interpretation 'silver fire' is likely correct.

	The White Tree
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Existed throughout the Years of the Trees (perhaps some 14,322 years1)
	Location:
	The mound of Ezellohar, to the west of Valmar in Valinor
	Origins:
	Brought into being by Yavanna
	Pronunciation:
	telpeh'reeon
	Meaning:
	Unclear, though telp&#235; is definitely 'silver'2
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Silpion, Ninquel&#243;t&#235;
	Titles:
	The White Tree
	The elder of the Two Trees of Valinor, called the White Tree, which shed silver light on the domain of the Valar.  His leaves were of dark green, shining silver beneath, and his boughs were decked with brilliant flowers that shed a rain of silver dew.Telperion endured throughout the Years of the Trees, but came to an end in the dreadful event known as the Darkening of Valinor.  Even though the elder tree did not survive, he was not the last of the White Trees.  Yavanna had made an image of him in Tirion, called Galathilion, from whom the White Trees of N&#250;menor and later of Minas Tirith were descended.  More importantly, one of Telperion's flowers survived the Darkening, and was set aloft by the Valar; this was the light we call the Moon.
	Notes
	1
	In the published Silmarillion, there's no hint as to the length of the Years of the Trees (except a rather vague reference to 'long ages').  However, a document does exist that gives more precise measurements, The Annals of Aman.  That is the source of the precise figure of 14,322 years, though it should be said that this unpublished figure was subjected to extensive editing, and should not be considered completely reliable.
	2
	Curiously, though Telperion is a Quenya name, the word telp&#235;, 'silver', is an element from the Telerin language. It was said to have been chosen over the Quenya word tyelp&#235; because of the particular delight that the Teleri had in silver, prizing it even over gold.The full etymology of Telperion is unclear.  It has been suggested that it contains the root-word rig, 'crown'.  This is entirely possible (the same root is known to appear in the name Celebr&#237;an, for example) but this cannot be stated with certainty.

	1
	The Annals of Aman (in Morgoth's Ring, volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth) even gives us precise datings for the invention of the tengwar.  R&#250;mil originally devised them in 1179 YT, and F&#235;anor devised his improved system in 1250 YT.  In our terms, then, they were invented about 3,075 years before the beginning of the First Age, and the F&#235;anorian version appeared some 680 years later.

Thain of the Shire
	[thain.txt]
	Title of the Oldbucks and the Tooks
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	From III 1979
	Location:
	The Shire
	Origins:
	A title originally conferred on Bucca of the Marish, and handed down through many generations
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Settlements:
	From III 2340, the seat of the Thains was a Great Smials in the Tookland
	Family:
	Originally the Oldbucks, but later the Tooks
	Meaning:
	From an Old English word thegn, used of chieftains, but originally meaning 'servant' or 'soldier'
	Other&nbsp;names:
	Shire-thain
	Title&nbsp;of:
	At least thirty-five Hobbits of the Shire
	The largely honorary title of the military leader of the Shire.  The first Shire-thain was Bucca of the Marish, and the title was held by eleven of his descendants the Oldbucks until their removal across the River Brandywine to Buckland.  Thereafter the title was held by the head of the Took clan, from Isumbras I onwards.It is known that there were at least thirty-three Shire-thains, from Bucca, who became Thain in III 1979, to Faramir I,  who took on the title in IV 63, more than a thousand years later.IBucca of the Marish(Thain from III 1979)The first Thain was given the title in III 1979 (379 by the Shire-reckoning) in a time when the northern lands were recovering from a devastating war in which the old kingdom of Arthedain had come to an end.  He was succeeded by Thains of the Oldbuck line.II-XITen Thains of the Oldbuck line(Thains for about 300 years to III 2340)Bucca was followed by Thains whose names are not recorded, but who took the surname 'Oldbuck' in honour of their ancestor.XIIGorhendad Oldbuck(Thain to III 2340)The line of the Oldbucks came to an end with Gorhendad, who crossed the River Brandywine and founded Buckland, changing his name to Brandybuck. The Thainship passed from him to the Took family, and Gorhendad was succeeded by the first Thain of the Took line.XIIIIsumbras I(Thain from III 2340)The thirteenth Thain in line from Bucca, and the first of the Took line.  Isumbras' descendants would hold the Thainship for the rest of the recorded history of the Shire.XIV-XXIEight Thains of the Took line(Thains for about two hundred years to III 2683)The eight Tooks to hold the Thainship after Isumbras I are nowhere named, but we can infer some of their identities from the names of later holders of the office.  Among these eight must have been Isengrim I, Ferumbras I, Paladin I and Isumbras II, but no records of their Thainships are known.XXIIIsengrim II(Thain for 39 years to III 2722)The twenty-second Thain, and tenth of the Took line.  He began the excavation of Great Smials, which would become the seat of the Thains in the Tookland.  He became Thain soon after the first pipe-weed was introduced into the Shire by Tobold Hornblower.  He was succeeded by his son.XXIIIIsumbras III(Thain for 32 years to III 2759)His younger son was Bandobras Took1, the famous 'Bullroarer'.  In Isumbras' time the Shire was greatly troubled by Orcs, and Bandobras defeated a band of them at the Battle of Greenfields during his Thainship. Bandobras, though, was Isumbras' younger son - the Thainship passed instead to his older brother.XXIVFerumbras II(Thain for 42 years to III 2801)He was succeeded by his son.XXVFortinbras I(Thain for 47 years to III 2848)At the beginning of his Thainship, the Shire would have seen much activity as Dwarves of Durin's Folk travelled westward to settle in the Blue Mountains.  He was succeeded by his son.XXVIGerontius(Thain for 72 years to III 2920)The famous Old Took, who held the office of Thain for a total of seventy-two of his one hundred and thirty years, and had a total of twelve children.  During his Thainship, the Shire suffered the dreadful privations of the Fell Winter, and invasions of White Wolves.  He was succeeded by the eldest of his many sons.XXVIIIsengrim III(Thain for 10 years to III 2930)Due to the Old Took's many years in office, his eldest son Isengrim was no less than eighty-eight years old when he inherited the Thainship.  He held it for just ten years and died without leaving an heir.  He was succeeded by his younger brother.XXVIIIIsumbras IV(Thain for 9 years to III 2939)Like his brother Isengrim, Isumbras came old to the Thainship, being ninety-two when he took office.  After his short time as the Shire-thain, he was succeeded by his son.XXIXFortinbras II(Thain for 41 years to III 2980)Early in his time as Thain there was a sensation in Hobbiton, due to the mysterious disappearance into the Wild - and later reappearance - of one Bilbo Baggins of Bag End.  Fortinbras was succeeded by his son.XXXFerumbras III(Thain for 35 years to III 3015)He was Thain at the time of Bilbo Baggins' famous farewell feast and Birthday Party, which indeed he attended. He never married, and so left no heir.  The descent of the Thainship passed to the line of Gerontius' fourth son Hildigrim, and specifically to Hildigrim's grandson.XXXIPaladin II(Thain for 19 years to IV 13)Born in the time that his great uncle Isumbras IV was Thain, Paladin took up a farming life at Whitwell in the Tookland. He was Thain during the War of the Ring, and held the Tookland against the ruffians who invaded the Shire at that time.  He was succeeded by his fourth child, but eldest son.XXXIIPeregrin I(Thain for 50 years to IV 63)Peregrin Took of the Fellowship of the Ring inherited the Thainship some thirteen years after his return from adventuring in the south, and held the title into his old age.  At the age of ninety-four, he gave up the office and rode away once again into the countries of the south with his friend Meriadoc Brandybuck; they were never seen in the Shire again.  He was succeeded by his son.XXXIIIFaramir I(Thain from IV 63)Named for Faramir the Prince of Ithilien, little is known of Thain Faramir, except that he married Sam Gamgee'sdaughter Goldilocks.  Doubtless he was succeeded by further generations of Shire-thains, but of them we have no record2.
	Notes
	1
	Confusingly, in the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings, Bandobras is stated to be the son of Isengrim II, not Isumbras III.  This seems to be a reference to an earlier phase in Tolkien's development of the Tooks' genealogy, in which he actually was the son of Isengrim (though Isengrim I, who would later be transformed into Isengrim II).  It seems that the Prologue text wasn't updated to keep pace with changes to the genealogy; it should more correctly describe Bandobras as either 'grandson of Isengrim the Second' or 'son of Isumbras the Third'.
	2
	It's safe to presume that there were at least two further Thains, because both Peregrin and Faramir are styled 'the first'.  It must follow, then, that at the very least they were succeeded by a Peregin II and a Faramir II.

	(Awoke or born at Cuivi&#233;nen)MelianTHINGOLOlw&#235;ElmoL&#250;thienBeren
	In his early life, millennia before the beginning of the First Age, Thingol journeyed to Valinor with Ingw&#235; and Finw&#235;, and was returned to the Eldar who dwelt at Cuivi&#235;nen. From the travellers' reports of the Blessed Realm, many of the Elves marched westward across Middle-earth, seeking the land of the Valar, and the third and greatest host of the Elves, the Teleri, were led by Thingol and his brother Olw&#235;.As they neared the western coasts of Middle-earth, Thingol came upon Melian the Maia in the wood of Nan Elmoth.  Long years passed, and at length he remained with Melian in Beleriand, though many of the Teleri passed West over the Great Sea.  With Melian, Thingol founded the woodland realm of Doriath in the central regions of Beleriand, and there ruled the Sindar for many years. Thingol's doom came upon him when Beren brought him a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown as the bride-price of his daughter L&#250;thien.  He summoned Dwarves from the Blue Mountains to set the jewel in the necklace Nauglam&#237;r, and the Dwarves became so enamoured of their work that they slew Thingol in his own treasury.
	Notes
	1
	It is usually assumed that Thingol awoke at Cuivi&#233;nen, being one of the first generation of Elves, and this seems likely, especiallygiven his own description of himself:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Elu Thingol, Lord of Beleriand, whose life began by the waters of Cuivi&#233;nen...'"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silmarillion, 22 Of the Ruin of DoriathThis is difficult to reconcile, though, with the fact that he had brothers, Olw&#235; and Elmo, andit may be that he was simply born there before the great migration to the West.  The date of Thingol's death, too, is a matter of some uncertainty.

Third Age
	[thirdage.txt]
	Last of the Elder Days
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	III 1 to 24 March III 3021
	The Third Age began a little over four thousand years after the Rising of the Moon in the first year of the First Age.  Of the Ages, it is the best known, as the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings took place in its later years.The Third Age began with the first overthrow of Sauron by the Last Alliance, and was marked by Isildur's planting of the White Tree in Minas Anor.  It ended more than three thousand years later with the destruction of the One Ring, the final end of Sauron, and the passing of the Ring-bearers over the Sea.The history of the Third Age is in large part the history of the D&#250;nedain in Gondor and Arnor.  Though both these realms were founded in the late Second Age, it was during the Third that they grew to their greatest heights, and fell to their lowest depths, before being reunited by Aragorn II Elessar.Key Events of the Third Age2Isildur plants a seedling of the White Tree in Minas Anor.  Returning northward to Arnor with the One Ring, he is waylaid by Orcs and slain.490Gondor is assailed by Men out of the East; the first of many wars with the Easterlings and Southrons.861Division of Arnor into Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan.c.1000Five Wizards, including Saruman and Gandalf, arrive in the north of Middle-earth.1050Gondor conquers the Harad, and reaches the height of its power.Also at about this time, the first Hobbits, wandering west across the Misty Mountains, first appear in records.c.1100The first stirrings of Sauron are felt again in Middle-earth, though they are thought at this time to signal the return of a Nazg&#251;l.1409The Witch-king of Angmar invades the northern kingdoms.1432Civil war in Gondor.1601The foundation of the Shire.1974The forces of Angmar capture Fornost; the remnant of the North-kingdom is destroyed.1975E&#228;rnur of Gondor brings a fleet to the north.  Too late to save the North-kingdom, he avenges its loss at the Battle of Fornost.  Angmar is destroyed.1980The Dwarves of Moria unleash Durin's Bane.2002Capture of Minas Ithil by the Nazg&#251;l.  It is renamed Minas Morgul.2050The last King of Gondor is lost.  The Stewards now rule in the King's name.c.2463Gollum acquires the One Ring.2510The Rohirrim ride to the aid of Gondor.  They are given the land of Calenardhon (Rohan) to dwell in.2941Journey of Bilbo Baggins to Erebor with Thorin and Gandalf.  The Battle of Five Armies.3019Destruction of the One Ring and passing of Sauron.

	The mightiest Eagle to ever live; lord of the Eagles of the Crissaegrim, and constant ally of Turgon of Gondolin.
	Notes
	1
	All the definite 'sightings' of Thorondor take place during the First Age.  We first encounter him helping Fingon rescue Maedhros from Thangorodrim when the Age had hardly begun, and he survived at least long enough to take part in the War of Wrath at the end of the Age.Thorondor's ultimate origins are uncertain, but he seems to have existed before the beginning of the First Age - perhaps a very long time before.  The Silmarillion tells us that the race of Eagles were sent by Manw&#235; to watch over the Noldor who had travelled back to Middle-earth.  Earlier versions of the story published in The History of Middle-earth state more explicitly that Thorondor was one of these, and that he even remained in contact with Manw&#235; during the First Age.Thorondor's fate is equally uncertain.  The only clue is a passage that appears in The Lord of the Rings, referring to '...old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young.'  It's plain from this that Thorondor departed Middle-earth some time after the end of the First Age. Perhaps the greatest Eagle of them all simply died of old age, but his mighty body carried a spirit sent by Eru, so perhaps, just possibly, he flew back to his master's halls on Taniquetil and still soars in the airs of the Undying Lands.

	King of the Wood-elves who dwelt in northern Mirkwood; he fought at the Battle of Five Armies, and his son, Legolas, journeyed with Company of the Ring.
	Notes
	1
	Tolkien gives us no explicit dates for Thranduil, so we need to rely on circumstantial evidence.  Thranduil's earliest mention is in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, where we're told that he was among the Sindar who travelled eastward from Lindon 'before the building of the Barad-d&#251;r'.  Sauron started building the Barad-d&#251;r in about II 1000, so Thranduil must predate this.We last hear of him soon after the Dark Tower's final overthrow.  On 6 April III 3019, (the Elves' new year), he met with Celeborn under the boughs of Mirkwood.  Though we never hear of him after this date, the purpose of the meeting was to define the kingdoms of the two lords.  It seems likely, therefore, he would have ruled in the newly renamed Eryn Lasgalen for some time after this.
	2
	Tolkien's reticence on the meaning of Thranduil's name needn't prevent us from indulging in a little guesswork. One reasonable possibility for the name's source would be tharanduil, a combination of elements that means 'beyond the long river'.  Though this is no more than speculation, Thranduil's history of travelling eastward from Lindon and ruling a kingdom across the Great River Anduin lends it some credibility.
	3
	The text of Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings seems to imply that Thranduil was himself the founder of the kingdom of Elves in Greenwood the Great.  However, later writings challenge this assumption, suggesting that Thranduil travelled eastward with his father, Oropher, who was the original ruler of the woodland realm.  According to this source, Thranduil did not become king until the loss of Oropher in the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age.  Whether this account should be considered canonical is open to question; for full details refer to Unfinished Tales of N&#250;menor and Middle-earth II 4 The History of Galadriel and Celeborn Appendix B.

Thr&#243;r&#146;s Map
	[throrsmap.txt]
	The map that guided the Quest of Erebor
	A map made by Thr&#243;r the King under the Mountain, after he had been exiled from his kingdom by the Dragon Smaug. As was traditional among the Dwarves, it was drawn with East at the top of the map, rather than North, and showed the Lonely Mountain of Erebor, the Running River that flowed from it, and the lands about.  It also contained mention of a secret entrance to the Mountain, and (written in secret Moon-letters) instructions as to how it might be opened.In his old age, Thr&#243;r set out to wander the lands of Middle-earth, but before departing he gave the heirlooms of his house to his son Thr&#225;in, including his Map.  Years later, Thr&#225;in too set out into Middle-earth, seeking to recover Erebor himself, and taking with him the Map to guide his way.  He was captured in the Wild by the servants of Sauron, but Sauron captured Thr&#225;in for the Ring of Power he bore, and so overlooked the Map he carried too.  This proved to be a serious oversight, because Gandalf secretly entered Sauron's lair at Dol Guldur while Thr&#225;in was a prisoner there, and managed to escape with the Map and the key that opened the secret door.Using Thr&#243;r's Map, his grandson Thorin was able to lead a small group of Dwarves (and one Hobbit, a certain Bilbo Baggins) on his own quest to refound the ancient Dwarf-realm.  Through many adventures, they were able to recover Erebor and bring about the destruction of Smaug, dealing Sauron a serious reverse.

	2
	We have no detailed information about Thuringwethil's nature or origins, but we are told that she was '...wont to fly in vampire's form to Angband' (Quenta Silmarillion 19, Of Beren and L&#250;thien).  If Thuringwethil could change her shape, as this suggests, then she was very likely a Maia or some similar being.

	A village or town located somewhere in the Shire, though its exact location is not known.  It is important to history as the home of many of Sam Gamgee's ancestors.  His great-great-grandfather Wiseman Gamwich came to Tighfield about two hundred years before the War of the Ring, and Wiseman's son Hob Gammidge is recorded as a roper, one of a long line of Tighfield rope-makers. Hob's grandson was Hamfast Gamgee, Sam's father, who left Tighfield for Hobbiton, to start a new life as a gardener.Tighfield's name probably descends from an old word for a common field or pasture, and this fits well with the fact that there seem to have been fairs held there.  Indeed, Hob's son Hobson, and in turn his son Andwise, were said to have often shown off their skills in a rope-walk there.  The Shire-hobbits loved punning place-names, though, and the fact that Tighfield was associated with ropes and roping is perhaps more than coincidence.

In Old English a tind is a sharp point, so the Tindrock was the 'pointed rock'.The tall point of the Tindrock stood up between two hills, one on either of the shores of Nen Hithoel: Amon Hen to the west and Amon Lhaw to the east.  In the great days of Gondor, these hills were important watch-posts at its northern borders.  The island of the Tindrock, though, had never been visited by Men, or so the legends said.

Tobold Hornblower
	[toboldhornblower.txt]
	The first Shire-hobbit to grow pipe-weed
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Flourished III 2670 (1070 by the Shire-reckoning)
	Race:
	Hobbits
	Culture:
	Shire-hobbits
	Family:
	Hornblower
	Meaning:
	'Tobold' is perhaps a contraction of 'too bold'1'Hornblower' is possibly a punning reference to his pipe-smoking habits
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Old Toby
	A famous Hobbit of Longbottom in the South-farthing of the Shire.  In his younger days, Tobold was something of a traveller, and made the eastward journey to Bree on several occasions.  It was there, it is generally supposed, that he came across the cultivation and smoking of pipe-weed.  Tobold must have collected some of these plants and brought them back to his own garden in Longbottom.  (At least, this is the most likely version of events - Tobold himself remained silent on the matter).The Southfarthing seems to have been ideal for the growing of pipe-weed, and it became one the Shire's most important industries.  Among the different varieties that were developed, one was named 'Old Toby' in honour of Tobold its first grower.
	Notes
	1
	Tobold's is potentially a very interesting name indeed.  If it does mean 'too bold', then there's a possible connection with a certain very familiar German surname.
	In the early October of 1529, the city of Vienna was besieged by the overwhelming forces of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.  The city's defenders made an insanely daring sortie against Suleiman's armies, driving far into the besieging forces before escaping with loss back to the city.  That attack is said to be the ultimate source of the title or surname Tollk&#252;hn, meaning 'madly bold' or 'foolhardy', and hence the ultimate origin of Tolkien's own name.
	From this point of view 'Tobold' could be seen as an English translation of the name 'Tolkien'.  Couple that with his strong link with pipe-smoking, and it seems that Tolkien might have felt a special connection of some kind with this character.

	The Fellowship of the Ring I 7,In the House of Tom Bombadil
	TOM BOMBADILGoldberry
	A mysterious and powerful being, called by the Elves Iarwain Ben-adar (Oldest and Fatherless), who dwelt in the valley of the Withywindle, east of the Shire.  What kind of being he was has never been certainly discovered (see The Riddle of Tom Bombadil below), but at some stage in the past, he seems to have settled at the edge of the Old Forest, setting himself boundaries, but boundaries within which his power was extraordinary.  Tom was a creature of contradictions, one moment defeating ancient forces with hardly an effort, the next capering and singing nonsensical songs.
	He appeared as an old man, at least in hobbit eyes, with a wrinkled and ruddy face, bright blue eyes, and a bristling brown beard.  He was said to be taller than a typical hobbit, but too short to be a Man, so he seems to have been about five feet in height.  His costume consisted of a blue jacket and yellow boots, and he wore an old and battered hat, surmounted by a feather.  He seems to have preferred to wear a swan-feather in his hat, but before he met Frodo and company on the banks of the Withywindle, he had acquired the feather of a Kingfisher instead.  In his own house, rather than a hat, he wore a crown of autumn leaves, perhaps revealing something of the elemental powers he possessed.
	The Riddle of Tom BombadilTom Bombadil is the prevailing mystery in Tolkien's work.  While almost every other aspect of Middle-earth is described for us in exacting detail, Tom is an enigma.  We have almost no clue of his origins or his fate, his purpose or even what kind of being he is.  It is no surprise that none of Tolkien's characters have attracted more discussion.This article makes no attempt to provide a definite answer to the 'Bombadil Problem' - it's very unlikely that a definite answer is possible.  What we will attempt, though, is to round up the more common suggestions, both from within Tolkien's cosmology and without, and discuss some of the arguments for and against each.Tolkien himself is uncharacteristically reticent on the question of Tom's identity:   "And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.  Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally)."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 144, dated 1954Fortunately, he gives us more clues than this suggests, but by no means enough to solve the mystery with certainty.There are two real approaches to the problem of Tom's identity; we can try to fit him into the cosmology of The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, or we can view him more broadly as a literary character.  We'll attempt both here, starting with a discussion of Tom in relation to Tolkien's fictional cosmology.1. Bombadil Within Tolkien's CosmologyTolkien's universe is inhabited by a multitude of races and beings: our problem is that what we know of Tom does not fit easily with any of these.  He seems almost to have been 'transplanted' from elsewhere.  In fact, this is almost certainly what happened, at least in a literary sense, but at this point we are concerned primarily with giving Tom a place within Tolkien's universe.Though there are many candidates to choose from, we can at least dismiss most of these immediately.  Tom is definitely not a Man, a Hobbit, a Dwarf, or indeed of any mortal kind, and we can also take it for granted, for obvious reasons, that he is not an Orc, a Troll, an Ent, a Dragon or an Eagle!  But this still leaves plenty of possibilities:Was Tom an Elf?Tom's capering, his wisdom, his great age and his love of song undoubtedly give him a certainly 'Elvish' quality.  This possibility though, is easily disproved by the following from The Lord of the Rings:   "'When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already...'"   Tom's own words, from The Fellowship of the Ring I 7, In the House of Tom Bombadil Tom would hardly have said this if he was an Elf himself!  This is, incidentally, proof of Tom's great age - the Elves 'passed westward' in the Great Journey some six Ages before he spoke these words.Was Tom a Maia?This a very common suggestion, to the extent that it is sometimes treated almost as 'fact'.  There is, though, no direct evidence for this - it seems to be based on the idea that since Tom can't be a Vala, and there is no other possibility, he must be a Maia.  As we'll see, these are both flawed assumptions - Tom might be a Vala, and there is at least one other possibility.Though we can't say for certain that Tom wasn't one of the Maiar, there are grave difficulties with this position.  The most important of these is that the Ring had no effect on him:   "Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight... There was no sign of Tom disappearing!"   The Fellowship of the Ring I 7, In the House of Tom BombadilThere were other mighty Maiar in Middle-earth at the time of the War of the Ring, especially Sauron, Saruman and Gandalf, and all of these were in some sense under the power of the Ring.  Yet Tom is unaffected by its power of invisibility, nor does he feel any desire to keep it (he hands it back to Frodo 'with a smile').  Tolkien himself points out the importance of Tom's immunity.  On this topic, he says:   "The power of the Ring over all concerned, even the Wizards or Emissaries, is not a delusion - but it is not the whole picture, even of the then state and content of that part of the Universe."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 153, dated 1954Was Tom a Vala?The last of Tolkien's named races (using the term loosely) that might include Tom is that of the Valar, the Powers of the World.  A common argument against this is that we know the names of all the Valar, and Tom isn't among them.  This doesn't hold water:   "...[the Valar] have other names in the speech of the Elves in Middle-earth, and their names among Men are manifold."   The Silmarillion, ValaquentaWhile of Tom himself it is said:   "'[Bombadil] was not then his name.  Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless.  But many another name he has since been given by other folk...'"   Elrond, from The Fellowship of the Ring II 2, The Council of ElrondIt isn't inconceivable, then, that Tom is one of the fourteen known Valar, dwelling incognito in Middle-earth.  Though we can't be certain, it seems likely that a Vala would be capable of resisting the power of the Ring, and so that difficulty can be set aside.  The 'Vala Hypothesis', though, is not without difficulties of its own, with perhaps the most significant being:   "'Eldest, that's what I am... Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn... He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from Outside.'"   The Fellowship of the Ring I 7, In the House of Tom Bombadil All of the beings who became Valar existed before Arda was made, so any of them could with justification claim the title 'Eldest'.  But Tom says he 'knew the dark under the stars' (that is, he was in the World, not outside it) 'before the Dark Lord came from Outside'.  The term 'Dark Lord' is uncertain here - it might apply to either Melkor or Sauron, and both originally came from 'Outside' the World.  If he means Melkor, then this is very significant: consider this description of the entry of the Valar into the World, from the original conception of the Silmarillion:   "Now swiftly as they fared, Melko was there before them..."   The Book of Lost Tales, Part I, III The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor'They' here refers to Manw&#235; and Varda, who were explicitly the first Valar to enter Arda apart from Melko (Melkor).  In Tolkien's original conception, then (and there is nothing in the published Silmarillion to contradict this) Melkor was the first being from 'Outside' to enter the World, and yet Tom suggests that he was already here when Melkor arrived!Admittedly Tom may be referring to Sauron, who must have come to Arda after these great ones, but the phrase 'before the Dark Lord came from Outside' seems to make more sense if he means Melkor (that is, he is referring to an event of cosmic significance, and a specific point in the World's history, which isn't the case with Sauron).This is only one of the objections to the Vala theory.  Another, for example, is that characters who we would expect to recognize a Vala living in their midst (especially Gandalf) don't apparently do so.There are many other arguments to be made both for and against Tom's status as a Vala. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, and some more concrete conclusions, Eugene Hargrove's fascinating essay Who is Tom Bombadil? is strongly recommended.Was Tom Il&#250;vatar Himself?Tom's powers are apparently limitless, at least within his own domain, and this has led a lot of people of suggest that he might be none other than Eru Il&#250;vatar himself.  There are certainly several hints in the text of The Lord of the Rings that this might be the case; he is called 'Master', and 'Eldest', and Goldberry says of him simply;   "'He is.'"   The Lord of the Rings I 7, In the House of Tom BombadilAll of these points might suggest that Tom and Il&#250;vatar were in some sense the same being. In fact, though, this is one of the very few theories about Tom that we can bring to a definite conclusion.  This point is touched on several times in Tolkien's letters, and each time he makes it clear that Tom and Eru should not be confused.  Perhaps his most definite statement is this:   "There is no embodiment of the One, of God, who indeed remains remote, outside the World, and only directly accessible to the Valar or Rulers."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien No 181, dated 1956If there is no embodiment of the One (that is, Eru), then Tom cannot of course be such an embodiment.Was Tom a 'Spirit'?The idea that Tom might be a 'spirit' (as opposed to a Maia or Vala) is certainly possible according to The Silmarillion.  Though it seems to be commonly assumed that only the Valar and the Maiar entered Arda, a tantalising glimpse of Tolkien's original vision survived into the published form of the work.  Here, discussing the Aratar or eight mightiest Valar, he says:   "...in majesty they are peers, surpassing beyond compare all others, whether of the Valar and the Maiar, or of any other order that Il&#250;vatar has sent into E&#228;."   The Silmarillion, ValaquentaThis single phrase 'any other order' seems to be a survival of a much older and more detailed account found in the Lost Tales:   "...brownies, fays, pixies, leprawns, and what else are they not called, for their number is very great... they were born before the world and are older than its oldest, and are not of it, but laugh at it much..."    The Book of Lost Tales, Part I, III The Coming of the Valar and the Building of ValinorIt is hard not to hear the echo of Tom Bombadil in these words, and perhaps here we see the first germ of his inspiration (the Lost Tales predate Tom's first appearance in print by about a decade).  Whether Tom is a brownie, fay, pixie or leprawn, though, is open to doubt - none of these creatures appears in Tolkien's published works, and their function as a bridge to later folklore seems to have been taken up, at least partly, by the Hobbits.This version of the 'spirit' idea doesn't address many of the other problems already discussed, though.  Why should a 'leprawn' be immune to the Ring when the Maiar are not?  Could a 'brownie' have entered the World before the first of the Valar?There is another kind of spirit that Tom could be though: a 'spirit of nature'.  Tolkien himself seems to support this point of view:   "Do you think Tom Bombadil, the spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside, could be made into the hero of a story?"   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 19, dated 1937This letter predates Tom's appearance in The Lord of the Rings (in fact, this quotation is part of discussion of the possible sequel to The Hobbit), so it is at best circumstantial evidence.The idea of a 'nature spirit', though, is certainly possible within Tolkien's universe.  Though this area of his cosmology is never directly addressed, Middle-earth seems at times to be full of spirits - at least some trees apparently have spirits, for example (consider Old Man Willow, or the Huorns of Fangorn).  Consider too:   "'But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember them.  Only I hear the stones lament them..."   Legolas, from The Fellowship of the Ring II 3, The Ring Goes SouthThere are numerous other examples of this kind: it is clear that in Tolkien's universe, the stuff of nature is somehow more alive, and more aware, than in the modern world.  It is a short step from this to the idea of 'spirits of nature', but a much longer one to 'spirits of nature' that wear yellow boots and live in houses.2. Bombadil as a Literary CharacterIt seems clear that, within the cosmos to which he belonged, Tom cannot be classified  with any certainty.  Outside that cosmos, though, we can at least reach some firmer conclusions (and offer some freer speculations).Tom's Origins in Earlier WritingsAt the time of writing The Lord of Rings, Tolkien had already completed a body of work that many writers would do well to equal in a lifetime.  Tom himself had appeared in print as early as 1933 (though the collection The Adventures of Tom Bombadil did not appear until 1961 - and in fact Tom only appears in the first two of these sixteen poems).  What's more, the Silmarillion was already well developed (though much of it as it existed then would be unrecognisable to readers familiar with the published version, a great deal of its narrative was already in place).It seemed at that time that the Silmarillion would never be published, and so Tolkien felt free to use names from that work in his sequel to The Hobbit: Glorfindel is the most famous example, but the names Gildor, Denethor, Boromir, Minas Tirith and many others besides all appear in both works, referring to different characters and places (the hyperlinks here refer to entries for the older versions).Tom must also have been part of this process, but in his case, his entire character, rather than just his name, seems to have been transplanted into the emerging Lord of the Rings. Tom's appearance in the early chapters is natural - Tolkien at that time seems to have envisaged the work as a children's book, a sequel to The Hobbit following the same style, and Tom certainly would not have seemed out of place.  As it grew, though, the world of The Lord of the Rings began to merge with that of The Silmarillion.  Here the difficulty seems to have arisen - a character like Tom, though he fits easily into the unconstrained story-telling of The Hobbit, doesn't have an obvious place in the detailed universe of The Silmarillion.Though Tom's insertion into the nascent Lord of the Rings might be viewed (at least in a sense) as 'accidental', it is certainly no accident that he remained there.  Tolkien reviewed and revised the book with his customary meticulousness - it is inconceivable that the character of Tom Bombadil would have stayed in place if Tolkien didn't see him, in some sense, 'fitting' with the rest of the story.  In Tolkien's own words:   "...I kept him in, and as he was, because he represents certain things otherwise left out."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 153, dated 1954In the same letter, he goes on to summarise what these 'certain things' are.  It is difficult to paraphrase his statements here: the suggestion is that while all sides in the War of the Ring seek, in their different ways, some sort of political power, Tom is immune from this in the same way that he is immune from the Ring.  He only wishes to understand things for what they are, and desires no control over them.  (This is a rather pale rendering of Tolkien's actual comments - for further study of this topic, a copy of The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, with special reference to Nos 144 and 153, is indispensible.)Tom's Place in MythologyTolkien's own understanding of what Tom represents in the Lord of the Rings seems to have evolved 'after the event': from what evidence we have, Tolkien apparently first decided that he wanted Tom in the book, and then rationalised his inclusion.  One of his earliest comments on Tom after the publication of The Lord of the Rings is:   "...he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 144, dated 1954In the same passage, he then goes on to give an account of Tom's literary function within the book, and the ideas that he represents.  But this is an account of ideas from an intellectual perspective, not of the 'feeling' that led to his original inclusion.  Here we will speculate a little (the word 'speculate' cannot be over-emphasised!) on Tom's mythological role, and where Tolkien's 'feeling' might have originated.  Before continuing, though, it's important to note that Tolkien himself disliked this line of reasoning.  Writing of an introduction to the Swedish version of The Lord of the Rings by a Dr &#197;ke Ohlmarks, he says:   "As for Wayland Smith being a Pan-type, or being reflected both in Bombadil and Gollum: this is sufficient example of the silly methods and nonsensical conclusions of Dr O[hlmarks]."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 229, dated 1961(Wayland Smith is a god of the Anglo-Saxons; Pan is of course Greek).  It is unclear here whether Tolkien is criticising Dr Ohlmarks' specific conclusions (sadly we have no record of what these were), or whether he is dismissing the role of mythological comparison altogether. Ultimately, though, Tolkien was in the business of creating his own mythology (intentionally or not); to avoid comparison with other mythologies is to miss a rich seam of material. Nonetheless, what follows should be read in light of his own comments quoted above.The particular aspect of other mythologies that we address here is the role of the 'mischievous outsider'.  This refers to a god or other being who in some sense does not 'belong' with the others (and indeed, is often literally imported into a mythology from outside).  Such characters may be meddlesome and irritating (like the Norse Loki, or the original form of the Arthurian Cei or Kay), but more usually they are simply jolly, frolicsome creatures (Egypt had Bes, the baboon-god, while the Greeks 'borrowed' Bacchus from the people of Thrace).  There are many other examples who fulfil this archetype: Coyote in North America, Ueuecoyotl in Mexico or the eastern monkey-god variously called Hanuman or Sun Hou-tzu (better known in the West simply as 'Monkey').It is not our concern here to discuss why this figure should be so universally represented, only to note that he is. (The word 'he' is used advisedly - this role always seems to be filled by a male).Is Tom Bombadil a 'mischievous outsider'?  He is certainly 'mischievous' (or, more precisely, joyfully unconcerned with the world at large), and we've seen that he is emphatically an 'outsider', in that he doesn't fit easily with the rest of Tolkien's universe.  What we're suggesting here is that these elements are not in any sense objections to his inclusion in The Lord of the Rings; in fact they are recommendations: they help to add an inherent sense of 'myth' to the book, that would otherwise be far less evident.This is not to suggest, of course, that Tolkien consciously considered these points.  Rather, to a man steeped in mythical tradition as he was, Tom would have 'felt' right as a character - he helps to lift the Quest of Mount Doom from mere 'legend' into the realms of 'myth'.  This perhaps (remember we are speculating wildly here) helps to account for Tolkien's imprecise 'feeling' about him.'Conclusion'There is only one answer to the riddle of Tom Bombadil: that there is no answer.  Though we've presented some of the evidence here, this article does no more than dip beneath the surface. It seems, though, that Tom's nature is ultimately undiscoverable, and this is surely a good thing.Part of the wonder of Tolkien's world is its depth and detail, but it needs its mysteries and unknowns too: if we knew everything about the World of Arda and its inhabitants, there would be no joy of exploration and discovery.  If nothing else, Tom Bombadil stands proudly as a symbol of the mysterious, and we should be glad that he does.

	In his preface to The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Tolkien tells us that Tom's name is 'Bucklandish in form', and suggests that it was given to him by the Hobbits of that region.  The resemblance of the -dil ending to the common Elvish -(n)dil, 'friend', is probably no more than coincidence.

	Notes
	1
	The 'rog' element of torog is reminiscent of the same element in Balrog, and the two may share a derivation from rauko, 'demon'.  Following this, and hints from The Etymologies (in volume 5 of The History of Middle-earth, a possible source of the name would be taur rhaug, where taur means 'vast, mighty, overwhelming, awful', and rhaug is the origin of 'rog', 'demon'.  Hence - assuming this speculation has any basis in reality - the name 'torog' would mean 'mighty demon'.

His rule lasted longer than a century, and was the longer by far than that of any preceding Gondorian monarch since that of his ancestor Meneldil.Turambar ruled Gondor for one hundred and twenty-six years, and was succeeded by his son, who became Atanatar I.

He did great service to both Doriath and Nargothrond, and is famed for slaying Glaurung, Father of Dragons, but the curse of Morgoth was on him, and evil followed him always.  In the Forest of Brethil he came upon his own sister, but through the spells of Glaurung they did not know each other, and wed.  After Nienor discovered the truth, she threw herself to her death, and in despair T&#250;rin fell upon his own sword.

	H&#250;rin IT&#218;RIN IHador
	The sixth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who succeeded his father H&#250;rin I to the Stewardship.  Like his father, T&#250;rin was named for a great hero of the First Age, and this seems to have become a trend in the House of the Stewards after his time.  For five generations after T&#250;rin, starting with his son Hador, his descendants were named for Elves or Men of the First Age.T&#250;rin ruled Gondor during the time known as the Watchful Peace, during which Sauron had withdrawn into the east and did not trouble the western lands of Middle-earth.  Hence, his time as Steward was rather uneventful in historical terms.T&#250;rin ruled as Steward for thirty-four years, and was succeeded by his son Hador.

Dior was the son of a Man and an Elf, Beren and L&#250;thien, and so had blood from both kindreds in his veins, and the same was true of E&#228;rendil the son of Tuor and Idril.  It was E&#228;rendil who succeeded in sailing into the West and pleading for mercy from the Valar, not for Elves or Men alone, but for the Two Kindreds together.

	The six 'grades' used to indicate modifications to a basic sound in Tengwar.  For example, where the first tyell&#235; referred to the basic 't' sound - the tengwa known as tinco - the other five tyeller would represent modifications of this basic sound.  In this case - the sequence known as the tincot&#233;ma - the next three tyeller would typically represent the sounds 'd', 'th', 'dh', while the meanings of the last two would vary according to the particular system in use.

	Pronunciation:
	tyelpe'tai(r)ma(The '(r)' here represents a 'silent' r - pronounce the word as if there were an 'r' as shown, but not the 'r' sound itself.)
	Meaning:
	'silver-series'1
	The word tyelpet&#233;ma in tengwar of the Quenya mode2.  The first character, equivalent to 'ty&#235;', is a palatal of the tyelpet&#233;ma series.One of the five t&#233;mar or sound-series of the tengwar as used to represent the sounds of the Quenya language.The tyelpet&#233;ma appears to have been unique; while each of the other four series consisted of a set of six individual 'letters', the palatal sounds of the tyelpet&#233;ma were formed by adding a mark of two dots beneath another character, as in the example above3.  This is the equivalent of adding a 'y' after the letter in English to form a single distinct consonant sound.  To use Tolkien's own example from Appendix E to The Lord of the Rings, the sound 'ty' here has the same sound as the initial consonant in the (British pronunciation of) the English word 'tune' - something close to, but distinct from, 'ch'.
	Notes
	1
	The choice of the Quenya word for 'silver', tyelp&#235;, is for purely phonetic reasons: it happens to start with a palatal sound, 'ty', that belongs to this series.
	2
	Replicating a specific 'mode' of tengwar is extremely difficult, and this transcription is necessarily approximate.  The difficulties are particularly acute in this case because examples of 'true' Quenya are extremely rare: most of Tolkien's transcriptions to tengwar are from Sindarin, English or, in the unique case of the Ring inscription, the Black Speech.
	3
	In fact Tolkien tells us that this was the 'usual' method of marking a palatised sound, not the only means of doing so.  We are given no hint, though, as to what other methods may have been used. (The Lord of the Rings, Appendix E (i), The F&#235;anorian Letters).

	Words of Gandalffrom The Fellowship of the Ring II 5 The Bridge of Khazad-d&#251;m
	The Sindarin name of Utumno, the fortress of Melkor in the far north of the World.  It was the first and greatest of Melkor's citadels, delved in the earliest days, the home to hosts of demons and monsters.  From Ud&#251;n, Melkor troubled the world for millennia.  From there, he destroyed the Lamps of the Valar, so that Powers left Almaren, their dwelling-place in Middle-earth, and removed into the West.  At the time of the awakening of the Elves, though, the Valar attacked Ud&#251;n in full force, and destroyed it utterly, carrying its master back to Valinor as their prisoner.The name Ud&#251;n is much less common as a name for Melkor's fortress than the equivalent Utumno.  In The Lord of the Rings it appears just once, in Gandalf's quote given above.  It survived, though, as a name for the northern valley of Mordor that lay behind the Morannon.  No doubt Sauron chose this name in memory of his ancient master's greatest stronghold.

	One of two Elvish names given to the flower referred to by Men as simbelmyn&#235;, or Evermind.  This name was used for the flowers that Tuor found growing around the Gate of Silver on the journey into Gondolin, and is not recorded after the end of the First Age.  Texts referring to the Third Age seem to prefer the Elvish name alfirin for the same white, star-like flower, but whether this signals a change of name across the Ages is not known.
	The Elvish name uilos is not literally equivalent to 'Evermind', but rather has a meaning closer to 'Everwhite'.  The 'Ever-' element in both these names alludes to the fact that the flowers didn't have a particular season, but instead appeared throughout the entire year.

	Location:
	A continent originally lying in the far West of Arda, now removed from the World
	Race:
	Ainur, but also inhabited by Elves
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Aman, Blessed Realm
	(conjectural)
	A name of Aman, or at least that part of it inhabited by the Valar, Maiar and Elves.  The island of Tol Eress&#235;a is several times identified as the easternmost of the Undying Lands, and, at the least, Valinor must also be included.'Undying Lands' seems to be a name that originated among Men1. The N&#250;men&#243;reans, especially, envied the seemingly endless life of those who lived in these regions.  From the first, the Valar placed a Ban on the Men of N&#250;menor, that they should not sail into the West from their island, or set foot on the shores of Aman.Wise as the Valar were, though, they did not foresee the wiles of Sauron.  This great Maia falsely persuaded the last King of N&#250;menor, Ar-Pharaz&#244;n, that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be undying himself.  Believing Sauron, Ar-Pharaz&#244;n assembled a great navy and sailed westward to make hopeless war on the Valar for the imagined prize of endless life.The Valar could not permit this: Manw&#235; called upon Il&#250;vatar, and the land of N&#250;menor was destroyed and lost forever.  The Undying Lands, which until that time had been part of the World, were removed forever from the reach of Mortal Men, though the Elves could still sail West and come there, if they would.It is to the Undying Lands that the White Ship sails at the end of The Lord of the Rings. The Ring-bearers, Bilbo and Frodo, were the first mortal beings to set foot on the shores of the Undying Lands2.  Tolkien is careful to point out, though, that even in Aman, mortals remain mortal.
	Notes
	1
	To an Elf, the condition of being 'undying' would be completely normal and natural - for one of the Firstborn to name a particular region as 'undying' would make little sense.
	2
	Strictly speaking, we should say '...probably the first mortal beings...'. At the end of the Akallab&#234;th, Tolkien hints that some mortals 'by some fate or grace or favour of the Valar... had come to the lamplit quays of Avall&#243;n&#235;...'.  It is just possible, then, that some unusually fortunate mortals had come to the Undying Lands at some point in the Third Age, before the Ring-bearers' ship at the Age's end.
	To complicate matters further, The Silmarillion states, or at least strongly suggests, that Tuor reached the shores of the Undying Lands with Idril.  His case is unique, though, because though he was born a Man, he was '...numbered among the elder race, and was joined with the Noldor...', so it may not be quite appropriate to speak of him as a mortal being.  The quotation above comes from The Silmarillion 23, Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin.

	The evil creature of spider-form who was Melkor's accomplice in the Darkening of Valinor, and who fled with him to Middle-earth.  The creatures that infested the Ered Gorgoroth were her offspring and descendants, as was Shelob who dwelt on the borders of Mordor.
	Notes
	1
	This quote comes from The Silmarillion: Of the Flight of the Noldor, which also tells us '...some have said that she ended long ago, when in her uttermost famine she devoured herself at last'.
	2
	Ultimately from ungw&#235; liante.  'Gloomweaver' is Tolkien's preferred rendering, but 'Gloom spider' seems to be a more literal translation.  In Elvish, 'weaver' and 'spider' are closely related words, and in English too: 'spider', 'spindle' and 'spinner' all share a common ancestry.

	In Appendix A (iv) of The Lord of the Rings, in the section recounting the history of the Stewards, we find an account of the first appearance of the uruks.  'In the last years of Denethor I the race of uruks, black orcs of great strength, first appeared out of Mordor, and in 2475 they swept across Ithilien and took Osgiliath.'  This passage seems to imply that the uruks actually appeared shortly before Gondor's great defeat of III 2475.

	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Fire-drakes
	Glaurung, first of the Urul&#243;ki
	The fire-drakes; dragons who breathed fire.  Glaurung, Father of Dragons, was the first of these.  He first appeared in the middle of the First Age, but the urul&#243;ki certainly survived the downfall of their master, Morgoth.Ancalagon apparently belonged to this kind1, and Smaug, the great fire-breathing dragon that sacked Erebor, seems to have been the last of the great urul&#243;ki. Other lesser types apparently survived to the end of the Third Age and beyond2.
	Singular Difficulties'Morgoth loosed upon the people of Narog the great host that he had long prepared; and Glaurung the Urul&#243;ki passed over Anfauglith...'Quenta Silmarillion 21Of T&#250;rin TurambarThis description of Glaurung contains a subtle peculiarity: urul&#243;ki is a plural, not a singular form, and doesn't seem to fit here (as if the sentence said, 'Glaurung the dragons').  The original manuscript for this section reads:'Later in the year, having gathered his strength and completed his design, Morgoth at last loosed his assault upon Nargothrond.  Glaurung the Urul&#243;k&#235; passed over the Anfauglith...'Commentary to &#167;277 of The Grey Annalsin The War of the Jewels(The History of Middle-earth vol XI)(our italics)Here, J.R.R. Tolkien uses the singular urul&#243;k&#235;, which seems to fit much more easily into the sentence.The reasons for this change are mysterious.  Conceivably, the published Silmarillion is in error, and should read 'Glaurung the Urul&#243;k&#235;'.  It's equally possible, though, that Christopher Tolkien had good reasons for making the change - perhaps he had access to material unknown to us, or simply wanted to avoid confusing the reader (since the plural form occurs earlier in the Silmarillion).
	Notes
	1
	Some sources prefer to exclude flying dragons like Ancalagon from the urul&#243;ki.  Tolkien himself gives us no solid details on this point, so there is no clear basis for classification.  The use of Elvish l&#243;k&#235;, 'serpent', might seem to suggest a flightless creature, but English dragon (originally Greek drakon) carries exactly the same meaning.  Hence 'dragon', 'drake', 'serpent' and the related 'worm' can be used interchangeably when referring to these creatures, and say nothing about their appearance.
	2
	In The Fellowship of the Ring I 2 The Shadow of the Past, Gandalf tells Frodo that, since the passing of Smaug, '...there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough...', so at least some dragons of this kind must have remained on Earth at that time.

	Valacar was the son and heir of the great King of Gondor, R&#243;mendacil II.  While R&#243;mendacil still sat on Gondor's throne, he developed a strong alliance with the Northmen who lived to the east of Mirkwood. To further the close friendship between Gondor and these Northmen, R&#243;mendacil sent Valacar as an ambassador to the court of their leader Vidugavia, who styled himself King of Rhovanion.R&#243;mendacil had intended that his son should learn something of the language and culture of the Men of Rhovanion, but he had not foreseen how strongly Valacar would be drawn to the Northmen.  He went so far as to wed Vidumavi, daughter of Vidugavia, a union that would bring great troubles in the future.The Northmen did not share the long lives of the Gondorians, and Vidumavi died even before Valacar had succeeded his father as King.  Nonetheless, she bore Valacar an heir.  He was raised with the name Vinitharya in the eastern lands, but returned to Gondor with his father as Eldacar.  These events caused unrest throughout Valacar's reign - it was believed that the pure N&#250;men&#243;rean blood of the Royal House would be lost.By the last years of Valacar's reign, certain southern provinces of Gondor saw this unrest break out into full rebellion.  In the year Valacar died, III 1432, this rebellion became a civil war, a dark and bloody period known as the Kin-strife that would last for the next fifteen years, until Eldacar managed to secure his throne.Valacar ruled as King of Gondor for sixty-six years, and was succeeded through great troubles by his son Eldacar.

Valandil of N&#250;menor
	[valandilnumenor.txt]
	The first of the Lords of And&#250;ni&#235;
	Valandil's father was Elatan of And&#250;ni&#235;, and his mother Silmari&#235;n, the eldest daughter of King Tar-Elendil of N&#250;menor.  He founded the line of the Lords of And&#250;ni&#235;, whose seat lay on the western shores of the island kingdom of N&#250;menor.  Though he was not on the direct royal line, he remained close to the royal house, and was important among the Council of the Sceptre (a post he passed on to his descendants).
	Valandil's mother Silmari&#235;n was Tar-Elendil's eldest child, but the Sceptre passed to her younger brother Meneldur because of the laws of succession at that time.  Those laws were later changed, and if those later laws had held at the time of Tar-Elendil's death, the Sceptre of N&#250;menor would have passed directly to Silmari&#235;n, and from her to Valandil and his descendants.  Long after Valandil's time, in fact, his descendants would become Kings in their own right: in direct line through many generations, Valandil was the ancestor of Elendil, the first High King of the D&#250;nedain in Middle-earth.  From Elendil, the line passed on through Isildur, Isildur's son (who was also called Valandil), and on across the generations to Aragorn himself.

Valaquenta
	[valaquenta.txt]
	The Tale of the Powers
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Apparently post-dates the War of the Ring1
	Origins:
	See Note 1
	Meaning:
	'Tale of the Powers'
	The 'Tale of the Powers', in which each of the Valar is named and described, together with the more important of the Maiar.
	Notes
	1
	The Valaquenta ends with a description of Sauron's destruction, and so its final form cannot date from before that event.  Much of the content, though, undoubtedly has earlier roots.  As Christopher Tolkien notes in his foreword to The Silmarillion, '...while it contains much that must go back to the earliest days of the Eldar in Valinor, it was remodelled in later times...'The tale's earliest origins are found in The History of Middle-earth (volume 4, The Shaping of Middle-earth).  There we find an account of a 'Golden Book' held on the island of Tol Eress&#235;a, read by a mariner named Eriol.  Eriol's brief account of the first pages of the book, consisting of less than two pages of text, formed the origins of the Valaquenta.In the earliest phases of Tolkien's work, Eriol was a pivotal character, a mortal mariner who found his way to the Lonely Isle and there learned the history of the Eldar. In later phases of the tales, though, Eriol disappears almost completely.  There remains a slight possibility that his journey into the West might have inspired the last words of the Akallab&#234;th, where we read of stories of occasional mortals sailing westward who '...had come to the lamplit quays of Avall&#243;n&#235;'.

Valar
	[valar.txt]
	The Powers of the World
	Race:
	Ainur
	Pronunciation:
	va'lar
	Meaning:
	'The Powers'
	Titles:
	Gods, Great Ones, Lords of the West, The Powers, Powers of Arda, Powers of the World
	Note:
	'Valar' is a plural term; the singular form is 'Vala'
	'Valar' is the name given to the fourteen powerful spirits who took physical form and entered Arda after its creation to give order to the world and combat the evils of Melkor.  They dwelt originally on the Isle of Almaren, but after its destruction long ages before the Awakening of the Elves they removed to Aman and there founded the realm of Valinor.Lords of the ValarQueens of the Valar (Valier) &#149; Manw&#235; S&#250;limo &#149; Varda Elent&#225;ri &#149; Ulmo &#149; Yavanna Kement&#225;ri &#149; Aul&#235; the Smith &#149; Nienna &#149; Orom&#235; &#149; Est&#235; the Gentle &#149; Mandos (N&#225;mo) &#149; Vair&#235; the Weaver &#149; L&#243;rien (Irmo) &#149; V&#225;na the Ever-young &#149; Tulkas Astaldo &#149; NessaThis table shows the fourteen Valar in 'due order' (i.e. in descending order of power).Names shown in bold indicate one of the eight Aratar,the mightiest of the Valar.These are the names of the Valar as they were known to the Eldar in Valinor.  In Middle-earth, they were known by other names of Sindarin origin; for example 'Elbereth' for Varda, or 'Araw' for Orom&#235;.  Their names among Men are said to be legion.The Valar in the Beginning of ArdaThe Valar were in origin the greatest of the Ainur who witnessed the Vision of Il&#250;vatarand so descended into E&#228; to fulfil the vision and create Arda.  It seems that, in the first beginnings of the World, the four mightiest spirits came down into it; Manw&#235;, Ulmo and Aul&#235; to prepare it for the coming of the Children of Il&#250;vatar, and Melkor to claim it for his own domain.There was conflict between Manw&#235; and Melkor, and Manw&#235; called many other spirits into the World to aid him in his struggle.  Among these were the other Valar, and those of lesser order known as Maiar.  Melkor then withdrew for a time from Arda to some other hidden place in the deeps of E&#228;.In time, Manw&#235; and his followers began to achieve their purpose, and make the World ready for the coming of the Children.  Seeing this, Melkor grew jealous, and returned to do battle over the fate of Arda.  The Earth then saw great upheaval as the rival powers struggled over its destiny (it is thought that the Misty Mountains were raised at this time).  Slowly, though, and with great hardship, the Valar succeeded in shaping the World, although everything they created was in some way marred by Melkor.The Nature of the ValarLike the Elves, those Valar who chose to enter the World at its beginning are bound to it until it reaches its destined end; they may not return to the Timeless Halls of Il&#250;vatar.As spirits, the Valar have no fixed physical form, although they often took the shapes of the Children of Il&#250;vatar.  They could, though, assume any form they chose, or cast aside their shape altogether and travel formless and invisible through Arda.
	The Fifteenth Vala?It seems that, in the distant beginnings of the World, there were fifteen Valar; Melkor was certainly the most powerful of the all the spirits that descended into Arda, and was said to have been the 'brother' of Manw&#235;.  However, due to his corrupt nature, he was apparently expelled from the order.  We are told in the Valaquenta that he is "...counted no longer among the Valar...", which strongly suggests that at one point he had been.

	Tolkien's use of vampire seems clearly influenced by its more modern associations, rather than its original Magyar meaning.

	One of three Stewards to serve King E&#228;rnil II of Gondor.  He was an important figure in Gondorian history, as the first of the Stewards to inherit the title by direct line from his father.  Vorondil was the son of Pelendur, the Steward who had assumed the rule of Gondor during the crisis following Ondoher's loss.  On Pelendur's own death, his position as servant and adviser to the King fell on Vorondil his son.Vorondil's Stewardship was a time of war and loss for Gondor.  In only his second year as Steward, he saw the Nazg&#251;l come out of Mordor and lay siege to Minas Ithil, and two years later still, they succeeded in capturing it and the palant&#237;r it contained.History remembers Vorondil less for any part in the loss of Minas Ithil, though, and more as Vorondil the mighty Hunter, who hunted the Kine of Araw in the far eastern lands on the shores of the Sea of Rh&#251;n.  The great horn carried by Boromir in The Lord of the Rings originated as the hunting horn of Vorondil, and may even have been made by his own hand.Vorondil served E&#228;rnil as Steward for twenty-one years.  Just as he had inherited the position, he was in turn succeeded by his son Mardil, who was to become the first of the Ruling Stewards and the founder of a tradition that would survive in Gondor for nearly a thousand years.

	[voronwe.txt]
	The guide of Tuor
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Known to be extant between c. I 472 and I 4951
	Race:
	Elves
	Division:
	Noldor

	Aranw&#235;VORONW&#203;
	A mariner of Gondolin, sent by Turgon to seek a passage to Aman and call on the Valar for aid against Morgoth. He failed, and was washed ashore in Nevrast, where he encountered Tuor and led him back as messenger of Ulmo to the city of Gondolin.
	Notes
	1
	We first hear of Voronw&#235; as a mariner sent south by Turgon soon after the destruction of the Havens.  C&#237;rdan's Havens fell in I 472, so Voronw&#235; must have been born before that date.  He is last seen guiding Tuor to Gondolin twenty-three years later, in I 495, after which he makes no further appearance in any canonical work.According to older traditions, though, he escaped the ruin of Gondolin and eventually sailed into the West, either with his friend Tuor, or even (in the earliest versions of the story) with E&#228;rendil himself.  Nothing of this has survived into the published edition of The Silmarillion.

Wain
	[wain.txt]
	A Mannish name for the Sickle of the Valar
	Dates:
	Created by Varda more than three Ages before the beginning of the First Age
	Meaning:
	Wain is an old word for 'Wagon'1
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	The Sickle of the Valar, Valacirca
	&quot;...the stars of the Wain were already twinkling...&quot;
	The Hobbit, 10 A Warm Welcome
	The seven stars of the Wain
	The name in the northern lands of Middle-earth for the constellation2 we know today as the Plough or the Big Dipper.  In Tolkien's mythology, these seven stars were set in the sky by Varda in the shape of a mighty sickle, as a warning to Melkor and his underlings.  The Men and Hobbits of the northern lands seem to have been ignorant of this, though: they gave these stars the more prosaic name of 'the Wain', meaning a wagon or cart.
	Notes
	1
	Tolkien's choice of the name 'Wain' must come from the real medieval name for this group of stars: Charles' Wain ('Charles' here refers to the Emperor Charlemagne).  Though Charlemagne has no place in Tolkien's world, the seven stars do form roughly the shape of a horse-drawn cart, and the name would have been natural in the setting of Middle-earth.
	2
	Strictly speaking, the Wain isn't a constellation - it forms part of the larger constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.

	&nbsp;&#149; Southern Army
	A confederation of Easterlings that descended upon Gondor and its allies, some two centuries after the time of the Great Plague, and remained a dire threat to the South-kingdom for nearly a hundred years.  The Wainriders, who took their name from the wagons and chariots in which they rode to war, quickly overran Rhovanion and soon came to battle with Gondor itself.  Narmacil II was lost in battle, and for a time all of Gondor's possessions east of Anduin were lost to it.  Narmacil's son Calimehtar won a temporary reprieve when he defeated the Wainriders on the plain of Dagorlad.After that defeat, the Wainriders planned a crushing revenge.  Allying themselves with the Men of Harad and Khand, they orchestrated a simultaneous assault on Gondor from the north and the south, and the South-kingdom came close to destruction.  King Ondoher was lost in the northern battles, but his general E&#228;rnil defeated the southern invaders.  The victorious Wainrider army in the north, celebrating their victory over Ondoher, suddenly found themselves set upon by E&#228;rnil.  In an encounter that became known as the Battle of the Camp, the Wainriders were put to rout, and those that survived fled back to their eastern domains.It was later seen that the invasions of the Wainriders, as so many of Gondor's perils, were engineered by the emissaries of Sauron. While Gondor's control of the lands east of the Anduin had been lost, the borders of Mordor had been open, and during this time the Nazg&#251;l had taken advantage of Gondor's plight to re-enter the land of their master.

	Timeline:
	Dates:
	20 June III 3018 to 3 November III 3019
	Location:
	The northwest regions of Middle-earth
	The great conflict at the end of the Third Age, named for the One Ring and the importance this had in the final outcome.  The war was fought between the Free (a loose alliance of Elves and Men led by the Wise) and Sauron the Dark Lord, with Saruman as a third power based in Orthanc.Sauron at all times held the military advantage in the War, due to his overwhelming forces; not only Orcs and Trolls, but Men of Harad and the East.  His main immediate object was the overthrow of Gondor, his near neighbour and the strongest of his enemies.  He had such forces at his command, though, that he was able to fight the war on many fronts, also attacking Dale, Erebor and the Wood-elves in the far north, and L&#243;rien from his secondary stronghold at Dol Guldur.  There can be no doubt that, had the Wise not achieved possession of the Ring, Sauron would ultimately have been victorious.Saruman had claimed alliance with both the Wise and the Dark Lord, but was ultimately fighting for his own ends.  In alliance with the Dunlendings, and having Orcs at his own command, his objective was the defeat of Rohan.  Until late in the War, he held the advantage, defeating Rohan twice at the Battles of the Fords of Isen.  He had not considered the Ents of Fangorn in his plans, however, and when they were roused to anger at his actions, they brought about his downfall.The policy of the Wise was based around the Quest of Mount Doom; a company of nine under the leadership of Gandalf travelled from Rivendell with the One Ring, with the hope of reaching Orodruin in Mordor and there destroying it.  Because the Ring held much of Sauron's native power, they realised that in unmaking it, they would also defeat its creator.  Against all hope, the Quest was achieved by Frodo Baggins, and Sauron defeated.The War did not end with the defeat of Sauron, for Saruman fled northward after the capture of Orthanc, and established himself in the Shire, bending the Hobbits to his will by threat of violence and the persuasive power of his voice.  The return of Frodo Baggins and his companions led to a rebellion by the Shire-hobbits, in which Saruman was killed by his servant, Gr&#237;ma Wormtongue.Although Sauron and Saruman were both defeated, the Wise did not achieve total victory.  With the destruction of the One Ring, the Three Rings that had maintained the realms of the Elves in Middle-earth lost their power, and the Elves began to leave Middle-earth for the Undying Lands.

Morgoth himself was taken as prisoner and shut beyond the confines of the World, and the Silmarils were recovered from his Iron Crown. In the tumult of the war, Beleriand and the lands to the north were destroyed and sunk beneath the sea, and the shape of Middle-earth was changed.

Tom Bombadil travelled to the lower reaches of the Withywindle to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered Frodo and his companions, and rescued them from Old Man Willow.  Goldberry seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the hobbits back to his house, they found a seated Goldberry surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.
	Like many other types of plant and flower, water-lilies were also known to grow in the verdant lands of Ithilien by the River Anduin.  Long after their adventure with Tom and Goldberry, Frodo and Sam found their broad leaves floating in a quiet stream running down to the Great River.

	[werewolves.txt]
	Enchanted servants of the Dark Lord
	Origins:
	At least some were made by Sauron1
	Meaning:
	Uncertain, but perhaps from Old English wer wulf, 'man-wolf'
	Dread servants of Morgoth in wolf-form.  Werewolves were especially associated with Sauron, who indeed took the shape of a great wolf himself at least once.

Were-worms
	[wereworms.txt]
	Mysterious denizens of the Last Desert
	Race:
	Not known: possibly related to Dragons
	Meaning:
	'Were' probably comes from the Old English w&#237;r, 'man'.  'Worm' in this context is more likely to mean 'dragon' than 'worm' in its modern sense.
	&quot;Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert.&quot;
	Bilbo Baggins,in The Hobbit 1: An Unexpected Party
	Creatures of an unknown kind, possibly mythical and presumably related to dragons, that were said to dwell in the Last Desert.Tolkien only ever mentions were-worms once, in the quote given above, so we know almost nothing about them. We cannot even be certain that they actually existed - the Hobbits had a rich folklore peopled with fantastic beings, and were-worms quite possibly fall into that category.If they did exist, the name 'were-worm' suggests a shapeshifting creature like a werewolf - a being that could take the form of either a Man or of a Dragon. Any discussion of the form or habits of the were-worms, though, must remain in the realms of speculation.
	The image conjured by the phrase 'wild Were-worms in the Last Desert' is remarkably resonant of the giant sandworms of Arrakis in the Dune novels.  It's appealing to think that this may have had a small part in inspiring Frank Herbert's writing, though of course there is no way we can know whether this is the case.

	Meaning:
	Approximately 'Western Lands'1
	General map of Westernesse showing its major settlements
	A name in the Common Speech for the Isle of N&#250;menor.
	Notes
	1
	Tolkien says the name is '...derived from rare Middle English Westernesse ... where the meaning is vague, but may be taken to mean &quot;Western lands&quot;, as distinct from the East inhabited by the Paynim and Saracens.' (From The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No 276, dated 1965).Whether intended by Tolkien or not, it is hard to avoid a connection between Westernesse and Lyonesse, the British 'Atlantis'.  This was a region of western Britain that sank beneath the waves in Arthurian legend, and was supposed to be inhabited by mighty men of old (some of Arthur's knights came from there: Sir Tristram was probably the most noteworthy of these).This Arthurian connection is not to be wondered at: Arthurian elements and themes often appear in Tolkien's work.  The most obviously connected placenames, for example, are Avall&#243;n&#235; (compare Avalon, and consider that the entire island of Tol Eress&#235;a was at one time called Avallon) and Broseliand, an original name of Beleriand, which is also the name of a faery region in the tales of Arthur.Whatever its source, the meaning is probably ultimately Old English westerne n&#230;s, where n&#230;s (modern ness) means literally 'promontory' or 'headland'. Tolkien was certainly aware of this (he used it himself in Taras-ness). Westernesse, of course, was not a headland but an island, but Lyonesse was a promontory, which hints further at an Arthurian connection.

	The military division of Rohan that lay to the west of the Entwash and Snowbourn rivers (excepting the lands around the capital at Edoras), commanded by a Marshal based at Helm's Deep.  Bordering on Rohan's enemies in Dunland, the West-mark was historically the scene of much strife.  The worst troubles in this region were seen during the Long Winter, when the Dunlendings forced the Rohirrim to abandon Edoras and flee to the West-mark, where they sheltered in Helm's Deep.
	Isengard also lay on its borders, so that the West-mark was of great importance during the War of the Ring.  The King's son Th&#233;odred was given the rank of Second Marshal of the Mark, and given the command of this region in the wars with Saruman.  He went to battle with the enemy at the Fords of Isen, where he lost his life.  The command of the West-mark was then taken by the lord Erkenbrand, who fought and lost a second battle at the Fords, but was able to rally enough of his forces to help in the desperate defence of Helm's Deep.

Westron
	[westron.txt]
	The Common Speech of Middle-earth
	Timeline:
	Other&nbsp;Names:
	Common Speech
	Meaning:
	Probably simply '(Language) of the West' ('the West' here refers to N&#250;menor)
	Derived mainly from Ad&#251;naic, the ancestral tongue of the Edain and their kin, the Westron was widely spoken by the Men of Middle-earth.  When the N&#250;men&#243;reans began to return to Middle-earth during the Second Age, Westron developed into a lingua franca allowing conversation between them and their distant kin. As the Second Age passed, and especially after the establishment of the N&#250;men&#243;rean kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor at the end of the Age, Westron became widely spoken by all races in Middle-earth, not just Men.  Hence it is often referred to as the Common Speech.As the chief language of the northwest of Middle-earth, Westron is naturally represented in Tolkien's work by modern English, even to the extent that names of the ancient Westron form are also translated into equivalent forms based on Old English (prominent examples being Hobbit, Rivendell and Shelob, although many others occur).  Hence, we have very few examples of 'real' Westron words and names.  There are in fact only two significant sources. The first appears in the isolated notes at the end of Appendix F II of The Lord of the Rings, where 'banakil', and 'kuduk' (both referring to hobbits) are given with some other examples.  The second source is the names of the N&#250;men&#243;rean kings from Ar-Ad&#251;nakh&#244;r ('King, Lord of the West') to Ar-Pharaz&#244;n ('Golden King'); these are in Ad&#251;naic, and hence closely related to Westron.

	Origins:
	Built by C&#237;rdan and the shipwrights of Mithlond
	&quot;In the twilight of autumn it sailed out of Mithlond, until the seas of the Bent World fell away beneath it&#133;&quot;
	The Silmarillion,Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age
	The ship that sailed from the Grey Havens into the Uttermost West, carrying the Ring-bearers to Aman.  Its departure marked the end of the Third Age.  On the White Ship sailed Elrond, and Galadriel, and Gandalf the White, who had been the Keepers of the Three Rings.  With them went the two Hobbits who had kept Sauron's Great Ring, Bilbo the Ring-finder and Frodo the Ring-bearer.  They were accompanied to the Grey Havens by Gildor Inglorion and many other Elves besides, but whether any of these others went aboard the ship with them is not told.  It does seem, though, that Gandalf's horse Shadowfax did make the journey: we see him waiting at the quayside in The Lord of the Rings, and in his Letters, Tolkien makes it clear that he sailed away with Gandalf.
	For most of the travellers, the voyage to the Undying Lands was a journey into the unknown, but not for all.  Gandalf had originally come to Middle-earth from Aman, some two thousand years before, and so the White Ship was carrying him home to the place where he was known as Ol&#243;rin, the wise Maia.  For Galadriel, too, it was a homecoming, but of a quite different sort.  She had been born in Aman long ago, and in the courts of Tirion she had listened to the words of F&#235;anor, following him willingly into exile in Middle-earth in defiance of the Valar.  For her, the granting of a return from exile was a pardon for her past misdeeds, and a reward for her aid in the War against Sauron.

	&nbsp;&#149; Telperion
	In the early days of N&#250;menor, its people still had the friendship of the Elves of Eress&#235;a.  Among the gifts the Eldar gave to the early N&#250;men&#243;reans, one of the greatest was a white seedling of the tree Celeborn that stood in the middle of their island.  Planted in the King's Court in Armenelos, the seedling grew into a fine White Tree that came to be known as Nimloth.  Its blossoms appeared as the Sun set, and their perfume filled the night in N&#250;menor's royal city.The tree of Tol Eress&#235;a, Celeborn, was itself descended from Galathilion, the White Tree that stood in Tirion that was made by Yavanna herself.  Its descendant Nimloth stood in the courts of Armenelos for thousands of years, but when Sauron gained control of N&#250;menor's government, he saw the White Tree as a link to his enemies the Valar, and ordered it destroyed.  So the White Tree of N&#251;menor was cut down and burned on the altar-fire of Sauron's temple.The line of Galathilion did not end in Sauron's flames.  Isildur the son of Elendil had stolen a fruit from the Tree before it was lost.  The fruit grew into a seedling that Isildur carried to Middle-earth with him after the Downfall of N&#250;menor.  That seedling was planted in Minas Ithil, and was destroyed before the end of the Second Age.  Its seedling in turn grew into the first of the White Trees of Minas Tirith, a line that was to outlast Sauron himself.

William Huggins
	[williamhuggins.txt]
	A Stone-troll of the Trollshaws
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	Turned to stone in III 2941
	Location:
	Trollshaws, in eastern Eriador
	Race:
	Trolls
	Division:
	Stone-trolls
	Meaning:
	'William' means 'Helmet of Resolve', and 'Huggins' simply means 'son of Huggin1', but 'William Huggins' is almost certainly not this troll's true name
	&quot;He wouldn't make above a mouthful ... not when he was skinned and boned.&quot;
	William Huggins' opinion of Bilbo Bagginsfrom The Hobbit 2, Roast Mutton
	With Tom and Bert, one of the three trolls encountered by Bilbo and the Dwarves on their eastward journey to the Lonely Mountain.  He seems to have been the leader of the troll-band - at least, it was he who led them to the woodlands of Trollshaws, according to his companions. It was William's pocket that Bilbo tried to pick as his first act of 'burglary', an attempt that brought the entire expedition close to disaster.  Luckily, Gandalf was able to trick William and his two companions into arguing together until sunrise, whereupon they all turned to stone.The name 'William Huggins' seems a very remarkable and unlikely one for a troll.  It seems to be a translation by Tolkien of the troll's 'real' name, as with the Hobbits, Dwarves, Rohirrim and so on, and the fact that it is recognisably English suggests that his original name was from a Mannish language.  What William's name actually was, though, is a mystery.  (By a curious coincidence, there was a real historical figure named William Huggins, a pioneering astronomer of the mid-nineteenth century, though it seems extremely unlikely that Tolkien's foul-mouthed troll would be based on this noted scientist!)
	Notes
	1
	The old name Huggin (a name related to the more familiar 'Hugh') can be translated 'little heart'.  Curiously enough, there is a character called Littleheart elsewhere in Tolkien's work - an Elf of Eress&#235;a in the very earliest forms of the Silmarillion legends.  There's no evidence to relate these two characters in any way, so this does seem to be no more than a strange coincidence.

Winged Creatures
	[wingedcreatures.txt]
	Airborne Steeds of the Nazg&#251;l
	Fetid black creatures raised by Sauron as flying mounts for his Ringwraiths.  The steed of the Lord of the Nazg&#251;l at the Battle of the Pelennor was described as naked and featherless, with wings of hide like a bat, and a long, sinuous neck.  In Ithilien, though, Frodo compared these beasts to giant carrion birds, a comparison that doesn't appear to match the other more detailed description.  Perhaps he was describing their wheeling, watchful flight, rather than the appearance of the Creatures themselves.
	Whatever the nature of the Winged Creatures, it seems that those used by the Nazg&#251;l were the last of their kind in Middle-earth, and had been grown to an unnatural size by Sauron.  Despite their size, they were not supernatural beings, but living creatures, and they could be hurt and slain: Legolas shot one with an arrow on the River Anduin, and &#201;owyn slew another on the Pelennor Fields.  The last of the Winged Creatures perished in Mordor, where they were caught with their masters in the erupting fires of Mount Doom.

This Withered Heath was famed and feared in the north of Middle-earth as the breeding-ground of the dragons.  At one time they had infested the Grey Mountains and the lands beyond, and even in the closing decades of the Third Age, the dragon Smaug still terrorised the inhabitants of the north.  Smaug was the last of the great dragons, but we know that other lesser members of his kind remained, so perhaps these still returned to the Withered Heath to continue their race.

	'Wolf' is a very ancient word indeed, descending to modern English through Old English wulf2
	Wolves were of old allied with the Dark Lord; Morgoth bred the two greatest of their kind, Draugluin and Carcharoth, and Sauron was wont to take the form of a great Wolf.  The lesser kinds were sometimes used as steeds by the Orcs.
	Notes
	1
	Strictly speaking, it isn't clear whether Werewolves should be considered a 'type' of wolf, but they were clearly related in some way to true wolves.
	2
	This Old English form of the word does actually appear in Tolkien's work.  Wulf was the name of the son of Freca, to whom Helm Hammerhand refused the hand of his daughter.  The Old Norse form of the word, ulfr, possibly also appears in the names of various Easterlings (such as Ulfang, whose name is interpretable as 'Wolf fang').

	The Old English wyrm itself seems to descend from an Old Norse word, ormr, meaning 'serpent'.  The Greek word drakon means 'serpent', too, so that if we follow the history of the words back far enough, 'worm' and 'dragon' both mean exactly the same thing.

	&nbsp;&#149; P&#250;kel-men
	A name among the Rohirrim for the shy, secretive people known in Elvish as the Dr&#250;edain.  Though never populous, the end of the Third Age saw these people reduced to a few populations in the southern parts of Middle-earth, especially in the Dr&#250;waith Iaur and Dr&#250;adan Forest of Rohan, where the Rohirrim came into contact with them.In fact, the word 'wose' is a name from British folklore, referring to a hairy, troll-like being supposed to inhabit woods and forests.  It represents Tolkien's translation of an actual word of the Rohirrim into ancient English; the Rohirrim themselves would not have called such a creature a 'wose', but a r&#243;g.

Wraith-world
	[wraithworld.txt]
	The other side
	Other&nbsp;names:
	The Other Side
	A mysterious alternative aspect of reality, into which the Ring could partly draw its wearer.  Certain beings, such as the Ringwraiths, seem to have led a dual existence on the boundary between two worlds: our own world and the Wraith-world.  While they had a partial form in our reality, they seem to have had a more solid existence in their own world.  They also had the ability to draw others into their reality, and attempted this with Frodo through the use of an enchanted weapon.  This power to draw others into their realm seems to have been used to terrorise their servants, too - 'they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side', says Gorbag in The Two Towers IV 10.
	The Wraith-world was not populated by wraiths and Ring-bearers alone: the Elves existed in a brilliant, shining form on the other side of the threshold.  At least, Frodo saw Glorfindel in this form while on the brink of the Wraith-world himself, and Gandalf later suggested that this nature was common to the High Elves.
	Though Tolkien goes into very little detail about this 'other side' to reality, it is mentioned often in accounts that have come down to our own time through folklore.  In these stories, it is commonplace to find fairies and elves - and less friendly beings -  moving between our world and their own mysterious realm.  Indeed, these stories are, in part, the origin of the idea of 'fairyland', and it seems plausible that Tolkien's idea of the ghostly Wraith-world is in some way related to them.  In the end, though, he gives us so little information that it is hard to do more than speculate the subject.

	After the accidental death of Saeros at his hands, T&#251;rin fled the land of Doriath where he had been brought up, and lived for a time among a band of outlaws beyond its western borders.  It was Saeros' taunts of T&#250;rin that had led to his death, and therefore T&#250;rin took a new name among the outlaws, Neithan, meaning 'The Wronged'.

	&nbsp;&#149; Freca
	&nbsp;&#149; Hammerhand
	A young nobleman who dwelt in the western borderlands of Rohan.  His father was Freca, who attempted to force a marriage between Wulf and the daughter of King Helm.  When Freca's plan failed, he was slain, and Wulf found himself declared the King's enemy.  He fled across the borders into Dunland, where he seems to have been warmly received (it was said that Freca's family had a measure of Dunlendish blood).  For four years, Wulf built up his power in Dunland, and allied himself with Rohan's enemies.
	In the year III 2758, with Rohan's armies drawn into the east to repel an attack there, Wulf and his allies invaded from the west.  They overran the country and took Edoras, where Wulf sat in the Golden Hall and claimed the Kingship of Rohan.  The true King, Helm, was driven into hiding in the mountains, and he died in the Long Winter that followed.  In the spring, Helm was avenged by his nephew Fr&#233;al&#225;f, who led a small party into Edoras and killed 'King' Wulf.  With help from Gondor, Fr&#233;al&#225;f cleared Wulf's followers from Rohan, and succeeded his uncle Helm to become its tenth rightful King.

	[yearsofthetrees.txt]
	The centuries before the Sun and Moon
	Timeline:
	Dates:
	A period of millennia1 before the beginning of the First Age
	The long years that lay between the founding of Valinor and its Darkening.  During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the Two Trees, but Middle-earth lay in darkness.Long before the Elves awoke, Yavanna created the Two Trees of Valinor to give light to realm of the Valar.  So began a reign of peace in Valinor, but Middle-earth was lit by starlight alone, and Melkor worked in the depths of Utumno in the north of the World.  We are not told how long this time lasted, just that 'the ages drew on'; this period would have lasted roughly 10,500 years. It was during this period that Aul&#235; made the Dwarves, and set them to sleep until the coming of the Elves.When Orom&#235; discovered that the Elves had awoken at Cuivi&#233;nen, great changes came about.  The Valar made war on Melkor to protect the Elder Children of Il&#250;vatar; Utumno was destroyed and Melkor brought in chains to Valinor.  The Valar also summoned the Elves to dwell in their land, and many answered this summons.A period of three ages (about 2,900 years) followed.  Melkor was imprisoned in the halls of Mandos, and the Valar and Eldar dwelt together in the light of the Trees.  In the darkness of Middle-earth, the Dark Elves who had not journeyed to Valinor still dwelt, and the Fathers of the Dwarves stirred. Men would not appear until some time after the end of the Years of the Trees.These Years came to an end when Manw&#235; released Melkor from his imprisonment. For a time, the Dark Lord pretended friendship with the Eldar, but he turned back to the darkness.  With Ungoliant, he destroyed the Trees, stole the Silmarils and fled back to the north of Middle-earth.  Seeking revenge, F&#235;anor led a great part of the Noldor out of Valinor and back to Beleriand.So the Years of the Trees came to an end.  At this time, the Valar made the Sun and Moon to give light to the World, and the Years of the Sun began, and with them the First Age.
	Notes
	1
	Tolkien provides precisely dated annals for the Years of the Trees, provided in the Annals of Aman (in Morgoth's Ring, volume 10 of The History of Middle-earth).  According to this source, the Trees shone for a total of 1,495 'Valian Years'.  Valian years are rather longer than solar years - one Valian Year is equivalent to about 9.582 Years of the Sun, so the Years of the Trees lasted in the region of 14,325 years, in our terms. All estimates of duration in this entry are based on figures from the Annals of Aman.

Yellow Face
	[yellowface.txt]
	Gollum&#146;s name for the Sun
	For long centuries, Gollum had hid with his Precious - the Ring - in the darkness beneath the Misty Mountains.  When he lost the Ring to Bilbo Baggins, he emerged at last to hunt for it, but after those long lightless years, he could hardly stand the light above the ground.  He came to hate the Moon, which he called the White Face.  Most especially, though, he shunned the Sun, which to him was a scorching Yellow Face, and hid from it in shadow, or under cover of night, whenever he was able.

	The Sindarin name for the race known to Men as Orcs.  'Yrch' is the plural form; the singular is 'orch'.
	Notes
	1
	The 'ch' here should be pronounced as in German, so that the word ends with the same sound as Bach, rather than torch.'oo' is close to the Sindarin vowel sound, but is not exactly correct.  Tolkien suggests a sound similar that in the French word lune would match the Elves' pronunciation more closely.  Note that in Gondor, 'y' was pronounced differently in Sindarin words, so that a native of that land would pronounce yrch more like 'eerch' than the 'oorch' given above.

	Notes
	1
	Zigil is known to be the Dwarvish word for 'silver', but the meaning of zirak is uncertain.  Mannish tine refers to a high point or peak; it is probably a fair assumption that the Khuzdul word has a similar meaning.  Zirak does appear in one other place, as a title or surname of Gamil the teacher of Telchar, so it probably carries the more general meaning of 'high' or 'tall'.
