	Attic red-figured cup by the Eucharides Painter. / Ht: 8,0 D.base: 8,4
	D.rim: 20,6 D.handles: 26,8 Broken into many fragments; repaired with
	considerable repainting along the cracks and in places where small
	fragments are missing. Cup with low flaring foot, offset stem, shallow
	bowl and two horizontal handles, circular in section. A large band of
	glaze on the underside of the foot. Exterior entirely glazed, except
	the interior of the handles and the handle zone. Interior: in the
	tondo, framed by meander-pattern, sits a young woman, facing to the
	right, on a high-backed chair. She wears a chiton with a himation
	draped on her lap and over her knees. Before her is a wool-stand, with
	a mass of wool on the supports at the top. The wool was rendered in
	added white which has subsequently flaked off, leaving only matte
	patches on the black glaze. The only other apparent details in added
	white, again flaked off, were firstly a fillet of dots around the
	young woman's head. She holds the distaff in her left hand and from it
	draws a long thread with her right, again in faded white. Finally, in
	the field to her right, a barely visible KALOS-inscription, again
	originally in white.

Sherd of stirrup vase

	[50.252]
	Sherd of stirrup vase. / The Stirrup Vase was an important storage
	vessel, with a function (at least for the larger ones) similar to that
	of the amphorae of later times. The modern name "stirrup vase" derives
	from the shape of the handle which looks a little like a stirrup. A
	solid cylinder with a flat disc at its top supports the middle of the
	"stirrup". The spout is set on the shoulder, to one side of the
	cylinder. It is of narrow cross-section to enable small amounts of
	liquid to be poured without spilling. The ancient name, from the
	evidence of the Mycenaean Linear B tablets, was probably 'chlareus'.
	Stirrup-vases began to be made in Crete towards the middle of the
	second millenium BC. Imported to the mainland sporadically in Late
	Helladic II, they became increasingly common amongst the Mycenaeans,
	and by the fourteenth century BC appear to be the most important
	strorage vessel, with a function similar to that of the amphora in
	later times.The smaller stirrup vase was later replaced by the
	lekythos and oinochoe. The largest stirrup vases were about half a
	metre in height, the smallest about one fifth that size. A pear-shaped
	variety with a narrow foot is very common. There were cylindrical
	types as well, and a dumpy, globular version was popular also.

Fragment of Pompeian wall-painting

	[80.49]
	Ht.: 44.5 cm; width: 31.3 cm; c. 1.3cm thick (3 layers). Broken and
	restored (see drawing). Against a black background a plant sprouts
	above a wide, horizontal white line. Its flowers, reddish with white
	highlights on high stems and long pointed leave, is an iris, a garden
	flower much appreciated by the Romans (the plant is probably Iris
	Albicans Lange, still to be found in the environs of Pompeii today).
	Freestanding plants such as this are very popular motifs on black or
	red backgrounds in the soccle zones of the Fourth Pompeian Style (c.
	2nd half of the first century AD). To judge from the size of this
	example, it must have come from a relatively small room.

Stemmed dish, Teano fabric (Campanian Gnathia pottery)

	[86.01]
	H: 6.0 cm. Diam.base: 5.6 cm. Diam.max.:13.6 cm. High ring foot,
	slightly convex inside with a conical hole extending into the stem.
	The outside of the foot is decorated withfive grooves, the central one
	being deeper than the others. Plan stem connects the foot with the
	dish; the dish itself is very shallow, with a wide rim, sharply offset
	both inside and outside. A further small offset on the floor of the
	dish. Rim horizontal, curving downwards slightly towards the outer
	edge.Resting foot and inside of the foot unglazed, but covered with a
	rich red miltos. Of the five grooves on the foot, all except the
	central one are incised; between the upper and lower pairs of incised
	lines, a row of dots in added white.
	In the centre of the dish, the following decoration in concentric
	circles: an incised line; a band of impressed concentric circles; an
	incised line; a band of impressed egg pattern (each enclosing three
	dots) and a band of impressed concentric circles; an incised line; a
	band of incised egg, each filled with a white dot, and separated one
	from the other by a white dot; an incised line just inside the offset
	on the floor of the dish. On the rim: an incised circle; a band of
	alternating palmette and lily in added white, connected by incised
	tendrils; an incised circle. All the incised lines on the dish, rim
	and foot, perhaps with the exception of the incised tendrils on the
	rim, appear to have been filled with red (miltos).

Plate, Teano fabric (Campanian Gnathia pottery)

	[86.02]
	H: 3.8 cm. Diam.base: 8.5 cm. Diam.max: 25.9 cm. Intact, and almost
	perfectly preserved. There is one chip on the rim, and some places
	where the added white paint has worn off a little; also a large crack
	on the floor of the plate, probably made during the original firing.
	The glaze is of good, even quality, although it has been discoloured
	in the centre of the plate; this was almost certainly caused by
	another vessel being stacked on top of the plate in the kiln. The clay
	seems to be a medium brown colour, without mica or other noticeable
	inclusions; well-levigated. Low ring foot with three crudely engraved
	grooves on the outside. The plate itself is very shallow, with a small
	offset (both inside and outside) separating the floor of the plate,
	from a wide, slightly flaring 
	rim. Resting-surface of the foot reserved; one band of glaze on the
	inside of the ring; on the underside, three bands of glaze (the
	central one thick) with a dot in the centre; heavy red miltos over all
	the reserved areas. An incised line at the junction of the foot and
	the plate. In the centre of the plate, an impressed gorgoneion,
	crudely rendered. Surrounding this, four impressed egg patterns (each
	filled with four dots) and four larger impressed palmettes. Between
	each palmette, three impressed concentric circles (arranged in a
	triangle) with an incised droplet pattern to either side. Then the
	following decoration in concentric circles: Incised ivy pattern, with
	the leaves and fruit (represented by groups of 
	three dots) in added white; a band of impressed concentric circles; an
	incised line (within a glazed groove); a band of impressed egg pattern
	(each filled with four dots); a band of impressed concentric circles;
	an incised line within a glazed groove; wave pattern in added white;
	an incised line within a glazed groove; a row of dots in added white;
	a glazed groove. On the rim, an incised line within a glazed groove;
	incised ivy pattern with leaves and fruit (represented by groups of
	three dots) in added white; an incised line within a glazed groove; a
	glazed groove. All the incised lines on this pot seem to have been
	filled with red (miltos), except for the line separating the base from
	the body. Compare: The Walters Art Gallery

Teano vessel in the form of a bird. (Campanian Gnathia pottery)

	[86.03]
	H: 10,3. L: 14,8. Diambase: 4,3. Intact, except for the "tail-feather"
	on one side which is chipped off and missing. Good black glaze,
	somewhat misfired towards the tail (especially on the underside) and
	tending there towards an olive-brown. Decoration in added white paint,
	very well preserved. Clay a medium brown colour (perhaps a little
	darker than 86.01 and 86.02?), without mica or other noticeable
	inclusions; well-levigated. Ring base, slightly concave inside, with a
	conical hole extending up into the stem. On the outside of the foot,
	three horizontal grooves; high stem. Body in the shape of a bird, four
	holes in a line in the middle of the back; these holes are enclosed by
	a raised oval moulding, to the side of which is a vertical ring handle,
	decorated on the outside with four grooves. Resting surface is glazed,
	as is the inside of the foot; the underside and the conical hole are
	unglazed. No miltos. On the foot, the the upper two grooves have been
	incised, and a row of ivy leaves in added white has been painted
	between them. Bird's eye formed by impressed circles, the outer one
	painted white. On the breast, two horizontal incised lines; a row of
	dots in added white between them, the same above, and a row of ivy
	leaves (each with a dot below) below. Outline of the wings incised,
	feathers indicated by incised tongue and added white dots and lines.
	On the tail, incised tongue with an added white line

Greek painted skyphos (Euboean type, made in Italy?)

	[86.04]
	H: 9,1 Dbase: 5,1 Dlip: 11,4 Dmax: 12,1 Intact; paint worn slightly in
	the area around one handle. A lack of chipping on the rim and foot
	would indicate that the vase was buried soon after manufacture.
	Well-levigated clay, hard-fired; no apparent mica. Fairly high,
	flaring rim, not offset from the body. Bulbous body, base slightly
	concave. Interior decoration: Entirely glazed, except for a reserved
	band at the rim. Exterior decoration: Base reserved; two broad
	horizontal bands of paint above the base. Below the level of the
	handles, three horizontal lines run around the body of the pot. From
	the upper of these lines, three groups of eight vertical lines on each
	side stretch up to the rim, forming two metopes on each side. Above
	the metopes, three horizontal lines.
	a horizontal band, and four more horizontal lines, the last of which
	is on the rim. Inside each metope, eight short vertical strokes above
	eight zig-zag lines (vertically aligned). On one side, another short
	vertical stroke under each zig-zag. Exterior zones reserved. It is
	clear that the metopal decoration was executed with a multiple brush,
	as the third stroke and zig-zag in each metope is invariably darker
	and thicker than the others. The same is true for the groups of
	vertical lines delimiting the metopes. The decorative elements of
	multiple dots and zig-zags within metopes finds its closest parallels
	in "Parian" pottery: Delos XV, Group Ae, esp. nos. 60, 62, 74-76.
	However, I find no parallels for the continuation of

Daunian "filter-vase"

	[86.06]
	Height 10,1; Dbase 5,3 Dmouth 5,2 Dmax: 12,8 Intact, with a number of
	small chips. Paint slightly worn in places. Handmade; clay a light
	brown with considerable mica; slip the same shade, slightly lighter.
	Paint: matt purple-brown. Closed vessel with a bag-shaped body,
	slightly hollow base. On one side a spout, about the maximum diameter
	of the body - liquid could have flown through the spout through five
	holes pierced in the body of the pot: this is the "filter" or
	"strainer". Opposite the spout, a bird protome. Between the protome
	and spout, a tall ribbon handle, connected just above the maximum
	diameter and just below the rim. Plain rim, slightly offset from the
	body.
	Decoration: below the maximum diameter, a broad band of paint. On the
	body, bordered by thinner horizontal lines, meandriform pattern above
	and below, separated by horizontal leaf pattern. A thicker band
	painted around and inside the rim. The spout is entirely painted, as
	is the head of the bird. The bird's neck is decorated with seven
	vertical rows of dots. The handle is painted with three vertical
	bands; a semicircular band on the body running inside the handle.
	Between the spout and the handle and between the protome and handle, 2
	vertical rectangular panels each containing a vertical leaf pattern.

	neck with beaked mouth, cut away at the back; ovoid body becoming
	cylindrical at the base; slightlyconcave turned base; loop handle,
	approaching semi-circular in section, attached at the back of the
	spout and at a point just below the maximum diameter of the body.
	Plain rim; neck cut away obliquely at rear and curled over to form
	spout. Intact; some minor chips and spalling. Fine, pale brown clay,
	with minute dark inclusions. Dull black gloss; additions overpainted
	in pale orange. Exterior, and inside of mouth to the neck are glazed;
	base reserved with a streaky sepia slip on the bottom (dilute black
	glaze).
	A dent on the body to the right of the handle, and on the neck to the
	left of the handle join. Decoration: On the neck, a vertical stems
	with 6 thin leaves departing from it obliquely on either side. Flanked
	on either side by a volute and a line following the curve of the
	spout. On the shoulder, a row of tongues between two lines; this

Part of a Late Roman mosaic: tree motif

	[88.01]
	171 x 57 cm. Cut, roughly squared stone tesserae ca. 0.5cm squared.
	The background is of white tesserae, arranged partly in an irregular
	fan pattern. In the lower part of the panel there are two complete and
	one partial flowers, the stems green and the flower/bud in pink and
	red. The tree is tall, straight and slender. The bottom half is trunk,

	the trunk. Within this foliage there are occasional fruits or flowers
	executed in pink and red. See perhaps: D. Levi, Antioch Mosaic

	padded stage tights, masks and phalloi. One, dressed as Herakles
	carries a club and lion- skin. He chases another figure who carries
	two round objects shown in added white paint. This figure is probably
	meant to be a slave, who has stolen two cakes from the hero. The

Iranian beak-spouted jar, painted

	[91.04]
	Ht. lip: 8.8; ht. spout: 9.7; diam. base: 7.9. Diam. lip: 7.9-8.4.
	Intact, with some chipping and spall-marks and apparent restorations
	on the end of the spout and around the rim. Flat base; low baggy body
	with a carination just below the maximum diameter. Short, gently
	flaring rim. Long trough spout, gently rising, and turned down
	slightly at the end. A vertical band-handle opposite the spout, from
	just below the rim to just above the carination. Thick, burnished and
	slightly lustrous yellow slip, 2.5Y 8/4 (pale yellow), The clay is
	difficult to see, but ti seems the same as the slip, but slightly
	lighter and less yellow, and with medium and large white inclusions,
	some of which have spalled the surface.
	Decoration in matt paint, which has an average colour of 2.5Y 4/4
	(olive brown), but which can be darker or lighter in places depending
	on the thickness of its application. There are two parallel lines
	along each side of the spout. On both sides, all the painted
	decoration is above the carination. On each side, a panbel bounded at
	the bottom by two bands and at the sides by sets of two vertical lines
	with cross-strokes between. Each panel is divided centrally by two
	similar vertical "ladders", and each half is then divided in half by
	two parallel diagonal ladders (in one of which the painter has
	forgotten to add the cross-strokes). Below the bottom of each ladder
	and below the lower borders of the panels, painted dots.
	The handle and spout are bounded by a vertical line of each side and
	horizontal bands below - 3 below the spout and 2 below the handle.
	Compare, for the form: E. F. Schmidt et al., The Holmes Expedition to
	Luristan (Chicago 1989) pl. 135m (from Khatun Ban, Iron Age IIA). Also

Iranian figurine in the form of a double-headed animal

	[91.07]
	Ht.: 18.6; Maximum length: 17.3. Broken into numerous fragments;
	repaired and reconstructed. It isnot always clear which are the areas
	of reconstruction. Clay: 2.5 Y 5/0 (grey) which numerous dark and
	occasional white and red inclusions. Fugitive slip 10YR 6/3 (pale
	brown). A handle (circular in section) departs from the centre of the
	top side, splitting into two parts (each of which is further split in
	two) which attach to each animal protome. The clay on the underside is
	5YR 6/8 (reddish yellow) with numerous small dark inclusions and

Iranian (?) green-glazed lamp

	[91.08]
	Ht.: 10,1; Diam. base ca. 5.5; diam. lip: 3.1. Part of the base is
	missing and restored, and there are minor restorations on the nozzle
	and shoulder; handle is completely restoredBlue-green glaze cracking
	and flaking in places; white fabric with numerous small dark
	inclusions. Spherical body with trough spout, high stem which is
	attached to a dish; low vertical neck and flat rim; a band handle from
	the lower body to the rim of the dish. The lamp is probably part of

Iranian (?) green-glazed lamp (a pastiche)

	[91.09]
	Ht. as restored: 11.7; diam. base: ca. 8.3. Broken and repaired, with
	areas of restoration on the handle, especially where the protome joins
	the handle, and at the join of stem and bowl. It seems certain that
	the animal protome, the upper bowl and the base plate/stem/handle did
	not originally belong to the same vessel. It also seems likely that
	the base plate, stem and handle belonged originally to a lamp like
	91.08, and the other two elements to vessels of different type. Base:
	Clay 5YR 7/6 (reddish yellow). Heavily chipped, especially on the rim.
	Blue/green glaze, turning olive green in patches. The stem, handle and
	bowl are glazed; part of the exterior of the bowl, and the underside,
	are reserved.
	The preserved part of the stem tapers upwards, then comes in sharply,
	and flares before the break. The handle is apparently genuine and
	unbroken, although the animal protome has been attached in modern
	times. The animal protome is glazed dark green with a very fine linear
	pattern of cracks through the glaze. The upper bowl: Clay 10YR 8/4
	(very pale brown) to 7.5YR 5/6 (strong brown). The glaze is a dark
	blue-green, and is cracked. Heavily chipped and abraded, with some
	small areas of restoration on the rim. The bowl has an incurving lip
	and three triangular spouts, all of which have been blackened by fire.
	On the rim are four lugs, each with a hole in the upper side. As these
	holes do not pierce the lugs, they cannot have
	been meant for suspension. I would not be surprised, though, if they
	are not imitating lamps which were meant to be suspended in this
	fashion. Monochrome green-glazed lamps are extremely common amongst
	Iranian Sirjan ceramics of the 10th and 11th centuries, although none
	are illustrated which are similar in form to those in the Nicholson
	Museum: Peter Morgan - Janet Leatherby, "Excavated Ceramics from
	Sirjan," in: James Allan - Caroline Roberts (ed.), Syria and Iran.
	Three Studies in Medieval Ceramics (Oxford University Press 1987)
	23-172, esp. page 81 and pl. 23. The fabric continues at least into
	the 13th and 14th centuries. The lamp is probably part of the Seljuk
	repertoire: Sotheby's New York, Sale Cat. 23.6.1991, Lot 234:

Iranian glazed bowl

	[91.10]
	Diam. base: 7.3. When taken apart in conservation, it became apparent
	that this bowl is reconstructed from over 50 fragments, not all of
	which belong to the same vase. The clay of the majority of the
	fragments is 7.5 YR 6/4 (light brown) with occasional micaceous
	inclusions. The exterior is reserved, with traces of brick-red and
	pink/purple matt wash. Most of the fragments appear to come from one
	bowl, which had glazed decoration on the interior; on a cream ground,
	the decoration is mainly in dark brown, with some use of olive green
	and dark brown, with occasional incision into the dark brown before
	firing. There are certainly some rosettes, the borders and centres of
	which
	are painted in dark brown with cream dots painted over, while the rest
	is filled with light brown. There are several fragments with dark
	brown, dark green and olive green glazed deocration on an olive-yellow
	base, rather similar in appearance to 91.11. Peter Morgan - Janet
	Leatherby, "Excavated Ceramics from Sirjan," in: James Allan -
	Caroline Roberts (ed.), Syria and Iran. Three Studies in Medieval
	Ceramics (Oxford University Press 1987) 23-172. 91.10 looks very close
	to their slip-painted wares with white engobe, especially Group 2 Type
	G: Bowls with Interlaced Circles with Green-Painted Medallions (p.
	71-72 and fig. 20). All of these bowls have a clear lead glaze on the
	inside and are unglazed on the outside, although the slip
	often spills onto the outside. Particularly striking in comparison to
	the bowl in the Nicholson Museum is the motif of a roundel surrounded
	with small and large dots, esp. figure 20, nos. 1-3 & 6. It is notable
	also the rare use of rouletting on the lower exterior of fig. 20 no.
	1, in exactly the same position as on Nicholson Museum 91.11. The use
	of incision is also quite common amongst these vases, see esp. Group
	3: Sgraffito Wares, p. 73ff, fig. 22ff. The date they propose for
	these vases from Sirjan in SW Iran (ca. 300 km north of the Straits of
	Hormuz) is ca. 950-1050 AD (p. 52). Compare generally, Sotheby's
	London, Sale. Cat. 21/10/1981, no. 92: Mesopotamian, 10th century

Iranian glazed bowl

	[91.11]
	Ht.: 10.2; Diam. base: 10.5; Diam. lip: 29.8. Reconstructed from many
	fragments with considerable areas (perhaps 30% of the total) of
	reconstruction and repainting. Clay 5YR 7/4-6 (pink - reddish yellow),
	fine, hard fired with rare small white inclusions. Flaring bowl with
	ring base. The exterior is reserved, and is covered in patches with
	lime encrustation. There are several series of short, parallel,
	diagonal grooves, which are presumably not intended as decoration, but
	are rather left over from the process of manufacture. On the interior
	there is some chipping of the glaze on the bottom of the bowl. The
	decoration is in dark brown, darg green and olive green on an olive
	yellow base;
	a combination of geometric and vegetal patterns with, apparently, four
	stylized birds. Compare, very generally for style, Sotheby's London,
	Sale. Cat. 14/10/1980, no. 160 - Buff ware, North-Eastern Iran, 10th

Pergamene bowl (imitation of Attic West Slope Ware)

	[91.12]
	Ht.: 6.5 - 6.7; diam. base: 3.5; diam. lip: 7.2. Intact, with minor
	chipping and flaking of the glaze over the entire surface. The black
	glaze is misfired to red over approximatelytwo-thirds of the surface,
	interior and exterior. The bowl in uniformly dark on the exterior
	around the rim, probably probably because the bowl had rested within
	another similar during firing. Clay: ca. 2.5YR 6/6 (light red). disc
	base with raised central moulding. Exterior: horizontal ribs to within
	ca. 2.5 cm of the rim and ca. 1.5 cm of the base. Interior decoration
	in added white and pale orange paint. Below the rim are two bands in
	orange paint. Below that, a zone of 4 palmettes (in orange) and 4
	dolphins (in white), alternating. 2 further bands in orange.

The front part of a figurine of an animal (deer?)

	[91.14]
	Ht.: 7.4; length: 6.9. The snout is broken into several pieces and
	reattached. Both earsare broken away, the right apparently in
	antiquity, and the left more recently. The front left leg is recently
	damaged, and the fragment missing. The clay is light grey in colour,
	fine and porous with occasional small white inclusions. This clay is
	covered with a dark orange/red slip wwhich on the surface is
	discoloured to various shades of dark brown and red, and is shiny.
	Curiously, this shiny dark surface is missing on the base, the legs
	and the back of the figurine. One might think that the figurine has
	been broken at some stage, and then repaired by filing away the rough
	and broken edges.

Life-size bust of male figure in black granite

	[R1138]
	Face slightly mutilated, right arm broken off; statue broken away
	below the chest. The figure wears a very fine garment, the folds of
	which can be seen gathered on the left arm; lightly incised, the
	collar of the garment can just be made out, lightly incised near the
	throat. The face is very similar to that of the Pharoah Horemheb, and
	resembles particularly another portrait in the Brooklyn Museum, New
	York. If the portrait is indeed of Horemheb, it must show him before
	he became king, as he wears no royal insignia. It most probably came
	from a tomb-chapel constructed for him before he gained the kingship.

Wooden reliquary chest belonging to a Flemish Guild

	[R1247]
	Ht: 27,2 Ht. with lid: ca. 53,0 L: 60,5 W: 35,0 t. From Reeve's
	catalogue: "Once it contained portions of the venerated remains of St.
	Hippolytus, and of St.Elisius - otherwise known as "St.Eloy." St.
	Hippolytus is supposed to have been contemporary with Saint Lawrence,
	who suffered death as a martyr at Rome, about the year A.D. 258. "St.
	Eloy" was a Frankish Saint who flourished about the 7th century. He is
	mentioned in a well known poem by Chaucer. On different parts of the
	reliquary are representations depicting incidents in the lives, and
	the real or supposed events after the deaths, of these two saints."
	According to Reeve again, the Flemish Guild was probably Saddlers or
	Harness Makers. Returned from the Powerhouse in 1993 (Loan 802).

Fragments of wood overlaid with painted gesso; probably a coffin

	[R77]
	Ht.: 63; maximum width 40. Owner: Priest of Amun and Scribe of the
	Divine Offerings in the House of Amun Nesypautytauri. The owner's name
	and titles appear above a scene of Osiris, seated at a table of
	offerings, receiving a libation from the deceased. Andrzej Niwinski of
	the University of Warsaw gave the following opinion (5/5/1977): These
	are fragments from the bottom of a coffin, very probably the same
	coffin, of the early 22nd Dynasty.
