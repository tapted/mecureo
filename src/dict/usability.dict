asynchronous groupware

	[1]
	software used to help people to work in groups, but not
	requiring those people to be working together at the same
	time. (asynchronous = not coordinating at a single point in
	time).

	Examples include:

	electronic mail

	the routing of forms through an office ("workflow")

	collaborative hypertext systems (such as the web)

	file-sharing systems that allow different people to edit the
	same file at different times

	version-control systems, often used in software engineering
	to coordinate changes made by multiple programmers to the
	same program

	document annotation, such as the markup used for editing and
	proofreading

	collaborative writing systems

algorithm animation

	[10]
	algorithms are the formal procedures for performing some
	computational task, such as the procedure to sort a set of
	numbers. An algorithm animation is a graphical display of
	process over time (auditory cues are also quite common).
	Algorithm animations are especially useful for teaching and
	explaining complex processes and for helping programmers to
	debug their programs. This illustration shows one frame of an
	animation of the Quicksort algorithm.

EBS

	[100]
	electronic brainstorming; the use of computers to support
	idea generation, especially in a collaborative setting.
	Computer support can be helpful by simplifying the collection
	and organization of ideas, by providing anonymity and thus
	supporting more fluid generation of ideas, and by providing
	support for analyzing, evaluating, and prioritizing ideas
	after they have been generated.

2-second rule

	[1005]
	a loose principle that a user should not need to wait more
	than 2 seconds for certain types of system response, such as
	application-switching and application launch time. The choice
	of 2 seconds is somewhat arbitrary, but a reasonable order of
	magnitude.

pilot test

	[1007]
	or formative test; an initial run of a study (e.g. an

simulator sickness

	[1009]
	virtual environment sickness or cybersickness; an adverse
	reaction to immersion in a 3D virtual environment
	characterized by symptoms of nausea, motion sickness,
	disorientation, and loss of control over movement. This
	reaction is typically explained by sensory conflict theory,
	the idea that the body reacts when visual and vestibular
	signals provide conflicting information about the body's
	orientation. Vestibular senses are orientation information
	from the inner ear.

brain-computer interface

	[1013]
	or brain-body interface; an interface directly controlled by
	brain waves as opposed to physical movement. Current
	state-of-the-art can only distinguish a few brain states, so
	such interfaces usually are led by yes-no decisions. These
	interfaces require training and are currently designed for

glare

	[1014]
	light that interferes with viewing a display, especially
	light reflected from the surface of the display. Glare can be
	reduced in several ways:

	the display can be positioned to avoid glare, generally by

multimedia

	[104]
	multimedia is typically used to refer to the use of any
	dynamic media: audio, video, or animation. When used in this
	sense, there are numerous issues in how people deal with
	motion, timing, change, and ephemerality.

	Strictly speaking, multimedia refers to the use of more than
	one medium at a time (including for instance, text and
	graphics, and possibly other sensory modalities such as touch
	and smell). From this perspective, the question is how people
	integrate two media - how do they map onto each other and

	an iterative approach that begins by developing basic
	requirements, building small simple prototypes, evaluating
	those prototypes, and then expanding into refined
	requirements and consecutively larger prototypes, until a
	complete deliverable product is created. Prior to the final
	product, each prototype is deliberately built with the

mental map

	[1043]
	(website navigation) a representation in a person's mind of
	the structure of a website, which is likely to be incomplete

	remembering what they've seen to the problem of remembering
	an overall structure rather than every page and link. When a
	mental map is a fairly accurate representation of the actual
	site structure, a person can use it to quickly navigate
	without a lot of mental effort. However, where the mental map
	doesn't match the actual site structure, navigation can be
	slower than optimal and people can make incorrect inferences
	about what is and is not included on the site.

open card sort

	[1045]
	a type of card sort that asks users to suggest | that topics
	group into. Users are provided with a list of topics (e.g.
	content pieces to go on a website) and are asked to group
	them and to label the groups with category labels. If the set
	of topics is large enough, they are asked to further group
	the groups or further subdivide the groups, labeling all the
	groupings.

	These groupings are then combined to determine a user-based
	conceptualization of the site structure, and the labels given
	are used as a starting point for labeling the site
	navigation.

closed card sort

	[1046]
	a type of card sort that asks users to sort topics into

	Users are provided with a list of topics (e.g. content pieces
	to go on a website) and are asked to sort them into
	pre-existing | (such as for adding topics to a currently
	existing site with a pre-existing structure). Combining
	suggestions from multiple users helps identify the optimal
	categorization of topics.

similarity matching

	[1047]
	a technique for identify conceptual |. Users are given a set
	of topics, and they are asked to rate the similarity of pairs
	of topics (on some scale, e.g. 1 to 10). These ratings can
	them be combined with a statistical technique called cluster
	analysis to identify groupings of topics that most closely
	match user ratings. However, the technique doesn't identify
	the label or "meaning" of those groups, so the person doing
	the analysis must interpret the groups and suggest labels if
	they are needed (or go back to users and ask for candidate
	labels).

	This technique can be used, for instance, to discover
	possible organizations of content for a website. It has the
	advantage over card sort techniques that the data from each
	user is somewhat richer (and therefore more informative), but
	it is generally more time consuming than card sorts.

wizard of oz prototype

	[105]
	a prototype that only works by having someone
	behind-the-scenes who is pulling the levers and flipping the
	switches. The wizard of oz technique in user testing has a
	user interacting with an interface without knowing that the
	responses are being generated by a human, not a computer.
	This allows testing of some difficult interface concepts
	before a system is fully working.

	For example, in a search system, a user may type in a query,
	and an expert behind the scenes rewrites the query in a
	formal syntax or hand-selects search results. This allows you
	to test theories in query formulation and filtering of
	results. Similarly, the wizard of oz technique is popular in
	testing natural language interfaces where, for instance, the
	choice of what syntax to support in the system is driven by
	what syntax users actually use during the tests.

persona

	[1054]
	a description of a specific person who is a target user of a
	system being designed, providing demographic information,
	needs, preferences, biographical information, and a photo or
	illustration. Typically, multiple personas are developed in
	the early stages of design that represent the spectrum of the
	target audience. Personas are one piece of a "scenario", the
	other piece being a description of how this person would
	typically interact with the system being designed.

	The point of developing personas is to avoid the trap of
	designing for the "average" user that doesn't actually exist,
	and instead to make sure that the system will work for
	somebody specific rather than no one in particular.

site visit

	[1055]

psychophysics

	[1056]
	a discipline of psychology that measures the response
	characteristics of human perception in a method parallel to
	measuring the response characteristics of physical materials.
	The prototypical examples are human perception of the
	intensity of light and sound. People report the intensity of
	sound as increasing linearly when the actual physical power
	is increasing exponentially. This is the basis of the
	logarithmic decibel scale.

speed

	[1058]
	a metric for human performance. How quickly does a person
	react to a stimulus (reaction time)? How much time does it
	take for someone to perform a given task (task completion
	time)?

	Also, a metric for system performance. How quickly does a
	system respond to user input (responsiveness)? How quickly
	can it process a given algorithm? How does its speed relate

tethered viewpoint

	[1059]

	actions control a remote representation of themselves, an
	avatar, or a device, that they can watch and control within
	the environment, as opposed to thinking of themselves as
	directly inside the environment. For instance, motion

satisficing

	[1067]
	a theory of human reasoning that says that people minimize
	cognitive load by minimizing reasoning and using quick
	heuristics to make decisions. Thus, people avoid complex
	memory, planning, and decision-making in favor of acting upon
	information immediately available perceptually, well-known
	information, and pretty good rules of thumb.

information foraging

	[1068]
	a theory of people's information-consumption behavior, where
	people are viewed as foraging for information like animals
	foraging for food. People tend to stay in one place (e.g. on
	one website) and exhaust the supply of information before
	moving on. This satisfies a cost/risk tradeoff because moving
	on to another location may not provide additional useful
	information. People also refine their goals based on what
	they find, so you can't treat information-seeking as having a
	steady target.

	As a result of these considerations, information should be
	designed to help people determine if they’ve exhausted the
	supply of information (e.g. by clearly indicating the scope
	of a website) and should provide opportunities for
	serendipitous discovery.

website topology

	[1069]
	the structure of connections between pages on a website.
	Typical structures include:

	hierarchy / tree - the most traditional is to organize a site
	into | and sub|.

	linear sequence - used for sequential stories or processes.

	matrix / grid - 2-dimensional grid, useful for 2-dimensional
	maps or for information spaces that vary along 2 dimensions
	(e.g. products available by size and color).

	full mesh - a site with every page linked to every other
	page, which is only really possible for small sites.

	arbitrary web - a set of links with no planned or explicit
	structure.

	hybrid - a combination of the above, which is how any
	practical, real-world site is actually structured.

color blindness

	[107]
	an inability to distinguish certain color combinations. About
	8% of males and 0.5% of females are colorblind in some
	fashion, so it is common enough to be a highly-significant
	factor in design. Red-green color blindness is most common,
	followed by yellow-blue color blindness.

	To avoid problems for users with color blindness, make sure
	that color is never the sole way of distinguishing objects.
	Never expect users to be able to name colors or recognize a
	color by name. Use differences in brightness to make colored
	regions distinct, and test your interfaces in grayscale to
	confirm that they are still usable.

ecological validity

	[1071]
	the extent to which the context of a user study matches the
	context of actual use of a system, such that it is reasonable
	to suppose that the results of the study are representative
	of actual usage and that the differences in context are
	unlikely to impact the conclusions drawn. All factors of how
	the study are constructed must be considered: how
	representative are the tasks, the users, the context, and the
	computer systems?

diagnostic evaluation

	[1072]

	system without identifying how to make an improvement.

context of use

	[1073]
	the situational factors that influence the use and usability
	of a system, including environmental factors (physical
	conditions such as space, time, temperature, noise),
	organizational factors (social network, management and
	organizational pressures, and work processes), and
	technical/system factors (network connectivity, system

conversion rate

	[1074]
	the percentage of people who achieve a given task from a
	given starting point. On websites, the percentage of people
	starting at page A who get to page B. So for instance, if
	1000 come to a homepage on a given day, and 600 of them click
	a link to a subpage, then you would say the site "has a 60%
	conversion rate of staying on the site after the homepage".
	Similarly, if 1000 people come to the homepage and 100 of
	those people bought a product, you'd say that "10% of site
	visitors were converted to buyers".

	Conversion rate is a common web metric to evaluate the
	performance of a site.

cognitive load

	[1075]
	the level of effort associated with thinking and reasoning
	(including perception, memory, language, etc.), thus
	potentially interfering with other thought processes. A user
	interface strives to minimize the cognitive load associated
	with operating the interface itself so that all of a person's
	cognitive resources are available for their task.

synthetic metric

	[1076]
	a value which is the result of combining other metrics, which
	are measurements of properties of designs, systems, or user
	performance. An example is to average the results of several
	subjective ratings scores that come from users responding to
	an interface, i.e. if we asked users to rate on a scale of 1
	(bad) to 10 (good) the attractiveness, interest, and ease of
	an interface, we could average these 3 scores and treat the
	average as an estimate of their overall subjective reaction
	(which may or may not be a useful metric).

	categories: <Usability Metrics>

descriptive metric

	[1077]
	a value that describes some aspect of a system. For instance,
	if we were trying to automatically evaluate a web page, we
	might want to rate its "text legibility" based on a measure
	of the font size used. An automated tool could identify the
	modal font size used on the page (a descriptive metric) and
	report this value. The metric identifies modal font sizes for
	different websites but makes no specific claim as to what the
	implications of that value are. This is in contrast to a
	predictive metric.

	related: {automatic evaluation} {predictive metric} {synthetic metric}

	categories: <Usability Metrics>

predictive metric

	[1078]
	a value describing some aspect of a system that purports to
	provide a prediction or estimate of the usability of the
	system. For instance, if we described the font size used on a
	web page as a predictive metric (e.g. claiming that larger
	sizes are more legible, at least up to a point), then a
	designer would suppose that because increasing the font size
	improves their "score", that doing so will also increase the
	usability of the design. This is in contrast to a descriptive
	metric, which makes no explicit claim as to the implications
	of the measurement.

redundant coding

	[1083]
	or secondary coding; representing information in more than
	one way so that users have more than one opportunity to
	perceive and understand it, to reinforce the information, to
	make the information more accessible (because one
	representation may not work for a certain technology or
	user), or to suit user preferences.

	A common example on websites it provide redundant text links
	in addition to a graphic navigation bar. Another example on
	websites is that links are both blue and underlined, so that
	a color-impaired user could see the underlines, and a user
	who chose to turn underlining off could still see the color.

learning time

	[1087]
	the amount of time it takes to acquire a new skill or piece
	of knowledge up to a given level of mastery. Since nothing is
	ever learned perfectly, target levels of mastery must be
	defined, such as the ability to complete a task (ever), the
	ability to perform a task at a certain average completion
	time, or the ability to perform the task with 5 or fewer
	errors.

	A common goal is to minimize the necessary amount of time to
	learn how to use software, or to make the learning time
	essentially zero (a "walk-up-and-use" interface).

	instructions right next to the part of the interface that it

	something that needs to be requested by the user, but rather
	is simply on the screen.

within-subjects design

	[1091]
	a study designed to make a comparison of 2 or more designs
	and that compares them by having each user try each design,
	measuring their performance for each design. The most common
	problem is that people learn over time, and so they
	frequently perform better on the 2nd design than the first,
	regardless of the relative quality of the designs. Thus, it's
	important to counterbalance such a study, having half the
	subjects start with one design and half start with the other,
	in order to avoid having the order effects give an advantage
	to one design.

random observation

	a type of field study to gather usage data, where you observe
	users at random points throughout the day to see what they're
	doing with your software at those times, thus capturing
	real-life as opposed to laboratory usage. Random observation
	saves considerable time versus constant monitoring of users
	(as in a day-in-the-life study), but may mean you don't get

skip link

	[1105]
	a link on a web page which, when clicked, skips down to a
	place lower on the page (i.e. a page link). The deliberate
	intention of a skip link is to enable a user to skip
	unimportant, uninteresting, or redundant information and get
	down to the useful information on a page. A typical use is,
	when designing web pages for the blind, to put a link at the
	top of the page that skips over standard company logos and
	navigation that would be redundant on every page so that the
	blind user doesn't have to listen to these items on every

selection bias

	[1106]
	in choosing test users for a usability study, selection bias
	is any imperfection in the selection process that gets either
	the wrong types of users (people who aren't in your target
	audience) or a sample of users that is not random and
	therefore is biased toward one type of user rather than
	another (e.g. even though you want to target both novice and
	expert users, you only manage to recruit expert users, so
	your results will be skewed). The most common example is a
	volunteer bias, since people who volunteer to be in a study
	may not be representative of your overall target audience;
	they may, for instance, have more free time, have a greater
	interest in technology, and be more outgoing than those who
	wouldn't volunteer.

situated action

	[1107]
	the notion that people's behavior is contextualized, i.e. the
	situation is a very important factor in determining what
	people will do. In the extreme view, this is the idea that
	you can't generalize and predict people's behavior from one
	situation to the next. Thus, this suggests an approach to
	usability which says to understand each user's or, more
	commonly, each organization's specific and detailed needs in
	designing software for them by carefully examining how they
	work and how situational and organizational factors fit into
	that process.

disability

	[1108]
	a mental or physical characteristic that limits the ability
	for someone to function at full capacity.

	Disabilities are frequently categorized into:

	visual impairments: blindness, low vision, color blindness

	hearing impairments: deafness, hard of hearing

	motor impairments: mobility impairments, difficulty using
	hands, muscular dystrophy, arthritis, paralysis, some speech
	difficulties, repetitive stress injuries (carpal tunnel
	syndrome)

	cognitive impairments: learning disabilities, dyslexia,
	language comprehension and production difficulties, memory
	loss

	In user interface design, these disabilities can be planned
	for and designs can be created to reduce or eliminate the
	impact of a disability on the use of computers using, for
	instance, accessibility aids.

	Other | of disability that may be less often considered but
	are still relevant to interface design include seizure
	disorders (sensitivity to strobing stimuli), personality
	disorders (such as attention deficit), sensitivity to pain or
	other tactile sensations, and allergies (such as
	sensitivities to metals).

demand characteristics

	[1109]
	a potential problem in user studies where people being
	studied have a tendency to behave in a way that reacts to
	what they think is expected of them. In user testing, for
	instance, people may tend to say an interface is good or bad
	if they hear the tester suggest that it is good or bad.
	People may tend to try harder during user testing than they
	would in natural situations because they believe they are

data-centered interface

	[111]
	a user interface designed to support users editing object and
	documents and not designed around the use of application
	software. Users focus on documents without worrying about
	which applications are being used and possibly using multiple
	applications on the document without realizing it. Some
	attempts to support this type of interaction in operating

baseline

	[1112]
	baseline is basically where things "are" in the sense that
	what we see is what is being done by a "majority" within a
	competitive space. Now you could argue that, because most are
	doing something, more audiences experience the same thing.
	But that depends on the weight of what we find in the
	analysis. If we discover that most content is found under
	similar/the same labels, then user expectations are best
	served by doing the same -- but this is NOT best practice.
	This is simply using convention to reduce guesswork.

	For example, on one project we had used 'Feedback' to label
	where visitors should contact the client in a number of ways.
	When given the scenario, "You would like to complain to that
	their navigation sucks," every single user looked for
	"Contact Us." The argument went, "doesn't that stifle
	creativity?" Yes and no. But that convention can change
	quickly. Basing designs on baseline is, in my opinion, a
	short-term measure for meeting an immediate need.

	integration (physical vs. mental), etc. Labels, on the other
	hand, come and go -- best practices endure, for the most
	part, longer than labels because they're more about patterns
	of behavior rather than convention. While patterns may
	change, they don't change as quickly as convention.
	Vocabulary in the English language is a good example of how
	quickly conventions change; but "best practices" for how to
	communicate really haven't changed a great deal over time.
	Why? Because we have uncovered patterns (via cognitive
	psychology, etc.) that people respond to with respect to
	verbal communication, and we have based our practices
	accordingly.

	So, while baseline can get us a certain distance, we
	transcend baseline by application of best practices in
	ferreting out user goals and task/domain expectations.

	Other definitions of best practice include:

	A recorded description of process that is recognized by
	experts as an effective, efficient and/or appropriate method
	for accomplishing a task. Because a best practice is selected
	from among competing processes that can yield similar
	results, it is in effect documented wisdom.

	A method or technique that is recognized by experts as
	superior to alternatives in its effectiveness and efficiency.
	Experiences that contribute to success support but are not in
	themselves best practices.

	Methods and tools that lead to sustainable improvement in
	quality, productivity, time to market, and/or, communication.

	Processes, practices, or systems identified in public and
	private organizations that performed exceptionally well and
	are widely recognized as improving an organization’s
	performance and efficiency in specific areas.

mental integration

	[1114]
	when the user is required to remember an item from a previous
	page to compare it to something on the present page, just the
	opposite of physical integration. Better designs will make it
	easier for the user to compare items by having them
	side-by-side.

	used. With tiering, only the most important and most-often
	used tasks would be available without an extra click. Tiering
	is representative of the continuum form of organizing

virtual terminal

	[126]
	A virtual terminal defines a set of capabilities that an
	application working over a network can assume that a user has
	at the user's local site. It responds to a network protocol
	that allows the specification of interactions with the user.
	A terminal can be a simple text terminal, a graphics terminal
	(like X Windows), or a multimedia terminal defining audio and
	video capabilities (to a limited extent, a Web browser fits
	this definition of a multimedia terminal).

	One important advantage of terminal standards is that they
	give the application an abstraction for the terminal
	capabilities, and the terminal takes care of mapping requests
	(for drawing graphics, writing text, displaying video, etc.)
	to whatever kind of hardware and software is available.

	simply releasing it and having it go to the next person who
	requests it, or by explicitly designating the next recipient
	of the token.

	term synchronous is used to contrast this type of groupware
	with asynchronous groupware, which does not allow users to
	interact together in realtime.

	Examples include:

	videoconferencing

	playing arcade games together

	shared drawing tools that allow people to see what their
	conversational partners are drawing as they draw

cognitive modeling

	[13]
	producing a computational model for how people perform tasks
	and solve problems, based on psychological principles. These
	models may be outlines of tasks written on paper or computer
	programs which enable us to predict the time it takes for
	people to perform tasks, the kinds of errors they make, the
	decisions they make, or what buttons and menu items they
	choose.

	Such models can be used in several ways: to determine ways of
	improving the user interface so that a person's task has
	fewer errors or takes less time, to build into the user
	interface to make software that reacts more effectively to
	help people use the system by anticipating their behavior or
	inferring their mental state (an artificial intelligence
	approach that may be used, for instance, in educational
	software, to provided the best customized instruction), or as
	a means of testing current psychological theory.

	Major modeling approaches include GOMS, ACT-R, Epic, and

session control

	[131]
	the mechanism for mediating which people and which objects
	can belong to a given interactive session.

	Important issues are the means by which users enter and leave
	a session, how a session is started and ended, and what
	resources are available to the session. An example would be
	controlling access to a chat room -- for instance, only
	people invited by a moderator might be able to enter a chat
	room, or a chat room might be limited to 15 people, and entry
	would be allowed to anyone when less than 15 people were
	there and entry denied when the room was filled.

session

	[132]
	an interactive connection involving more than one person and
	including all of the objects that they are sharing.

	For instance, a videoconferencing session could be set up
	between two people which included a video connection and a
	shared whiteboard (a session is sometimes referred to as a
	call in traditional telecommunications terms).

	The concept of a session is for the user to see a view which
	specifies who is being talked to and what each person can do.
	From the system's point of view, the session is important in
	allocating resources for users (such as CPU resources) and
	network resources (such as phone and video connections). From
	a designer's perspective, a session is an important concept
	because of the need to display session information to the
	user and control access to the session.

serialization

	[133]
	the process of strictly ordering events. When two users

	crucial to decide in what order those actions occurred and to
	impose the same ordering in the view of each user.

role

	[134]
	a means of expressing that participants in a conversation
	come with different skills and interests and should have a
	user-interface that reflects their personal needs.

	Roles such as chairperson, scribe, and facilitator reflect a
	set of access capabilities to shared objects in a session.
	Multiple users can have the same role (e.g. members of the
	Red Team) and users can have multiple roles (e.g. a user can
	be both a member of the Red Team and a team captain).

	Roles in society often reflect standard behaviors and tasks,
	which may not always affect whether people in those roles
	have access to certain functionality, but may quite often
	reflect how often they use a certain functionality, and
	therefore affect how an interface is optimized for each role.
	Roles may determine how people are involved when playing out
	a "script", such as a restaurant script, where the waiter
	plays a role which suggests bringing out food and asking if
	the customer would like dessert, and the customer plays a
	role which involves sitting down at a table and making
	choices from a menu.

visual programming language

	[14]
	a programming language whose interface is graphical, as
	opposed to the most common textual languages (such as C,
	Lisp, Java, etc). The idea is to improve the
	comprehensibility of the code by choosing an optimal
	notation, not one which is constrained by the need to display
	the code in a text format.

	Some common approaches to visual programs include displaying
	programs as flowcharts, using dataflow diagrams (which look
	somewhat like layouts of electronics, showing components
	which send data through wires to other components), or
	restricted languages such as state machine diagrams. Many
	languages are hybrids, part-text and part-visual, and display
	certain components, such as the user interface, in a visual
	way while showing the remainder of the program code as text
	(e.g. HyperCard and Visual Basic).

floor control

	[142]

	-- for instance, controlling access to a shared whiteboard
	(so only one person can draw at a time) or determining who
	can speak during a chat session (determining who "has the
	floor").

	Floor control can be applied to any particular access
	permission of an object, but typically it refers to the right
	to edit an object while all users are able to view the
	object. Some examples of floor control are: allowing all
	users to edit the object concurrently, having a moderator who
	decides who has write permission for the object, or having a
	token which is passed around to give each user write
	permission as the token is held.

delay

	[144]
	a measure of the time it takes for a message to be

	also an important measure. Delay affects the perceived
	fluidity of a conversation and becomes a more serious problem
	as the number of people involved in the conversation
	increases (i.e. if the amount of delay varies, the time to
	coordinate between people is the longest delay involved in

	because the same movement is used not only to select but also
	to specify position, whereas clicking with a mouse is
	independent of the movement to indicate the position.

website design

	[150]
	the process of designing the content, the look and feel, the
	structure, the navigation, and the implementation of a
	website.

	Website designers are user interface designers who design for
	a specific domain which is challenging for the wide variety
	of users, platforms, and browsers, and the common problems
	(among many others) of network performance, first-time and
	one-time users, and the powerful conflict between
	establishing brand identity and following predictable
	conventions.

	Website design is a young and very rapidly changing field.
	Good website designers need to have a very solid background
	in the fundamentals of user interface design and need to
	focus on usability processes, such as user testing, rather
	than relying strictly on usability guidelines which quickly
	become obsolete due to the changing technology and user
	population on the web.

iterative design

	[151]
	the idea that design should be done in repeated cycles where,
	in each cycle, the design is elaborated, refined, and tested,
	and the results of testing at each cycle feed into the design
	focus of the next cycle.

	This is identical in spirit to the notion of developing a
	software product through a series of continually-refined
	prototypes, and the idea of developing generations of a
	software product through an iterative development cycle (such
	as the Spiral model of development).

widget

	[152]
	any of a variety of interactive objects in a graphical user
	interface. Widgets are generally meant to metaphorically
	suggest real-world controls. A widget can be a button, a
	menu, a scrollbar. It can refer to a more complex object like
	a window or dialog box which also contains other widgets.
	Widgets are visual. They have some behavior: they respond to
	input and they change what they're displaying.

	User interface toolkits provide programmers with easy ways to
	display and use widgets and sometimes to design their own
	widgets.

	Widgets are the most obvious visual contribution of GUIs.
	They're ideally intuitive. They're fun. They're familiar.
	They occur again and again so users become accustomed to
	using them.

snapshot

	[153]
	(groupware) a quick photo of another person that updates
	periodically to provide a basic awareness of their presence.
	(Also called a "porthole".)

	Snapshots are vaguely similar to a videoconference, except
	that no audio is provided, the frame rate is intentionally
	quite slow (so the person's movement is not distracting), and
	the idea is not to be looking at the person and conversing
	with them, but to just have a general sense, as if they were
	working in the same room as you, of whether they are there,
	what they might be working on, and whether they are busy or
	they can be interrupted.

	Snapshots are potentially quite useful for closely-knit
	workgroups who wish to coordinate even though they aren't
	co-located.

chording

	[156]
	an input mechanism which requires pushing more than one
	button simultaneously in different patterns to represent
	different letters or commands.

	"Chording keyboards" allow rapid entry of letters and words
	which can allow faster typing than conventional keyboards and
	permits one-handed operation of keyboards.

	"Chording mice" are mice with multiple buttons where clicking
	with more than one button is equivalent to having an
	additional mouse button.

	Chording is a powerful tool for some users, but chording is
	more difficult to learn and should never be required of
	users. In particular, many people with arthritic conditions
	or other motor impairments may find chording extremely
	difficult (though note that one-handed operation may be
	extremely helpful to users without the use of one hand).

WYSIWYG

	[157]
	(WHI-ZEE-WIG) what you see is what you get. A term used for
	direct-manipulation user interfaces.

	The idea is that any operation that you visually perform is
	what is actually happening to the underlying data structure,
	and whatever you edit on the screen is also what you get when
	you print it out.

force feedback

	[158]
	the application of physical force in response to user input.
	Used, for instance, in arcade games and car and plane
	simulators. A force feedback input device, such as a mouse or
	joystick, can provide redundant tactile feedback of what's on
	the computer screen or can be used to provide "sticky"
	regions to help users avoid dangerous operations, for
	instance.

gestalt principles

	[159]
	principles of perception that address the interpretation of
	arrangements and relationships of objects; the whole is
	greater than the sum of the parts. Some of the common
	principles are:

	good continuation - objects along a common path form a unit

	proximity - objects that are close together are related

	common fate - objects that move in the same direction and
	speed are a unit

	similarity - objects with similar properties (color, shape,
	etc.) are related

proxy

	[160]
	a small image that serves as a graphical preview of an
	operation that will take place on a full image. The proxy
	usually substitutes a generic shape for the full image or
	eliminates detail otherwise. Used commonly in dialog boxes
	that operate on images - for instance, an "Align Objects..."
	dialog box can show a preview of aligning all selected
	objects along their left edges.

closed captions

	[161]
	a visual text view of audio that is in a sound byte or video
	clip. Closed captions are an excellent provision for the
	hearing impaired, for nonnative speakers who may find written
	language easier to understand than spoken language, and for
	people who work in a noisy environment or a work environment
	where noise would be unacceptable.

face-to-face

	[162]
	or FTF; people interacting with each other in the same place,
	as opposed to over a telephone, for instance. Refers to group
	meetings, group work, and groupware interactions which are
	co-located, in contrast to "distance" or "distributed" work.

teleworking

	[163]
	working at a distance from your office or workplace, using
	telecommunications technologies to access the information at
	your workplace, i.e. telecommuting.

	categories: <Groupware>

clinical workstation

	[164]
	a computer in a clinical setting. Clinical workstations will
	usually need to provide some of the following capabilities:

	mobility - many clinical users must frequently move between
	patients in different rooms

	ruggedization - in some clinical settings, a computer may be
	exposed to a rough environment, and may need to conform to
	sanitation protocols

	security - access to terminals in public and in private areas
	needs to be secure to avoid unauthorized personnel from
	accessing or tampering with patient data

	reliability - downtime of critical computer equipment has the
	possibility of degrading patient treatment

	handsfree or one-handed operation - in many situations,
	clinical users need to have one or both hands free to handle
	other tools or to assist patients. In situations such as
	surgery, minimal equipment contact is preferred for sanitary
	reasons.

competitive user testing

	[165]
	a comparison of 2 or more user interfaces from competitive
	products used for marketing or product design purposes. When
	used for marketing, fairly rigorous procedures must be
	applied to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the result.

	related: {competitive analysis} {user testing}

	categories: <Usability Evaluation>

focus group

	[166]
	a group of potential users or stakeholders in a product who
	are brought together to gather information as input to the
	design process. When the users are current users of a prior
	version of a product, the questions for them will usually
	focus on the use of that product. Typically the goal is to
	understand the users' work processes and goals and gather
	functional and usability requirements for a product.

	In contrast to interviewing individual users, a focus group
	offers the opportunity for the users, rather than the
	interviewer, to strongly determine what the important issues
	are for discussion. Focus groups offer the possibility that
	an unexpected comment from one person will lead to deeper
	insights from others. Focus groups are often more
	time-efficient than interviews, and when they involve
	stakeholder, they can be valuable for obtaining consensus on
	issues.

	Focus groups are more difficult to guide than individual
	interviews and may suffer from groupthink problems, where the
	entire group gets focused on a topic of relatively little
	importance.

collapse box

	[168]
	a box used in a window's title bar (in MacOS) that causes the
	window to shrink or expand, leaving only the title bar
	visible in its shrunken state. This functionality has also
	been called WindowShade, metaphorically referring to the idea
	of pulling up window blinds.

	Collapsing the window is similar in spirit to other systems
	where a window is minimized to an icon or a text label, but
	has the advantage of maintaining the window at its current
	location with the full title and still draggable and
	closable, thus maintaining most of its integrity as an
	object.

criterion testing

	[169]
	user testing that measures user performance to determine
	whether a target performance level has been reached.
	Typically a project will begin by determining usability
	requirements in terms of target performance along various
	benchmarks, e.g. "starting from the website homepage, the
	average user will be able to locate the contact phone number
	within 10 seconds". A criterion test measures whether the
	user meets the requirements.

	This is in contrast to:

	testing to find problems which will be corrected

	which interface is better

object-oriented programming

	[17]
	(OOP) a programming technique and a characteristic of
	programming languages often associated with graphical user
	interfaces. Object-oriented programming treats data items as
	"objects" belonging to a category of related objects with
	similar functionality called a "class". Classes are organized
	in a hierarchy such that classes inherit properties and
	functionality from their parents in the hierarchy.

	"modal dialog boxes" are ones that prevent the user from
	doing anything else until the dialog box is dismissed.

	"modeless dialog boxes" allow access to other windows and

dropdown menu

	[175]
	in a menubar, an item you can click that brings down a list
	of options to choose, typically used to perform commands or
	set options.

	Not always used to refer to items in a menubar, a menu can
	also appear on other parts of a screen, such as in a toolbar
	or dialog box, in which case it is sometimes called a popup
	menu. Pulldown menus are similar, except that "pulldown"

	software, but relevant to almost any human artifact. What
	makes an artifact easy to use? Broadly, something is easy to
	use to the extent that it effectively performs the task for
	which it is being used. Ease of use can be measured by how
	quickly a task is performed, how many mistakes are made, how
	quickly the system is learned and how satisfied people are
	who perform the task. Usability may also include factors such
	as safety, usefulness, and cost-effectiveness.

co-discovery method

	[181]
	also "constructive interaction"; a user-testing technique
	where users work collaboratively to solve problems on a
	computer. The advantage over single-person testing is that
	the users talk about what they are doing naturally (as
	opposed to using a think-aloud protocol) and they help each
	other through difficulties instead of getting indefinitely
	bogged down.

	Co-discovery is also a technique used in learning. By having
	learners work on computers together, they learn from each
	other and avoid having as many problems with computer skills
	getting in the way of solving the significant problem they
	are addressing.

metaphor

	[195]
	the use of one idea or object to represent another; making an
	implicit comparison between concepts to provide insight into
	those concepts.

	Metaphor is used widely in graphical user interfaces to help
	set users' expectations and make the behavior of computers
	clearer. The "desktop metaphor" is used to suggest that a
	computer screen is like a physical desk, with papers and
	folders to shuffle around and various desk accessories, such
	as calculators, printers, and notepads. A general physical
	world metaphor is what allows a beveled border to suggest a
	button and allows close parallel lines to suggest that
	something is draggable.

	Metaphors are also useful techniques for designers to explore
	representations of concepts and the behavior of interface
	elements. Designers may also apply wild and unrelated

instructional design

	[196]
	the design of an educational system, focusing on how people
	learn and how learning can be facilitated. An instructional
	designer will set educational objectives for the system and
	design the interaction to avoid straying from those
	objectives. A wide variety of approaches are available to the
	instructional designer:

	a presentation system presents information to a learner as a
	book or video might, with the focus being to make the
	information sufficiently interesting to engage the
	reader/viewer. This "passive learner" approach is not
	considered to be most effective.

	a drill-and-practice system gives the learner exercises to
	complete, evaluates performance, and presents further
	exercises to focus on weak areas.

	a user-modeling approach creates software which analyzes the
	student's mistakes in solving problems to create instruction
	which is customized to help the student overcome their
	misconceptions.

	an exploratory environment is one in which a learner can
	construct less-constrained solutions and try out ideas
	without having a fixed path to knowledge. Simulation systems
	are common examples.

	a collaborative learning system focuses on fostering learning
	through the interaction of multiple students, e.g. CSCL
	(computer-supported collaborative learning).

awareness

	[2]
	the sense of what other people are doing, even when you're
	not communicating with them directly.

	Awareness is useful for coordinating with others in
	collaborative tasks where direct communication is not always
	necessary. Awareness also refers to indirect forms of
	communication even while involved in a direct conversation,
	such as making inferences about what someone is doing based
	on the position of their chair or the lighting of their room.

	Awareness mechanisms in groupware include systems that let
	you track whether people are in their offices and what tasks
	they're working on (e.g. "what file is my co-author working

RAD

	[20]
	a Rapid Application Development tool. These are tools, such
	as Visual Basic and Delphi, which are designed to make
	developing software applications a faster process, usually by
	focusing on the design of the user interface in terms of
	screen layout and widgets.

direct manipulation

	[200]
	performing operations by making changes to data directly,
	such as clicking on it, dragging it, resizing it, and typing
	over it, as opposed to indirect operations, such as typing in
	commands on a command line or using menus and dialog boxes.

ephemeral awareness

	[201]
	information about others and their activities that changes
	quickly, such as their current facial expression, location,
	or posture; as opposed to more permanent awareness
	information about them, such as their current address, job
	position, or favorite food.

graceful degradation

	[202]
	the quality of a system or design such that when something
	goes wrong, it happens a little at a time and with plenty of
	opportunity to take action to correct the problem or at least
	protect against its worst consequences.

	For instance, a system that permits you to save changes to
	your currently open documents before it has to reboot because
	of a system error is more graceful than one that simply
	reboots.

human factors

	[203]
	the field that studies the role of humans in human-machine
	systems and how systems can be designed to work well with
	people, particularly with regard to safety and efficiency.
	Traditionally this field was from an engineering and
	industrial design perspective and was applied to industrial
	systems, such as airplane controls, factory systems, and car
	design.

interaction design

	[204]
	the design of how a user communicates, or interacts, with a
	computer. Interaction designers focus on the flow of
	interaction, the dialog between person and computer, how
	input relates to output, stimulus-response compatibility, and
	feedback mechanisms.

	This is in contrast to a visual designer, who may be trained
	in designing visualizations for static media but not
	necessarily in the dialog which is present in all interactive
	media. A "visual interaction designer" is a visual designer
	with interaction design skills. Interaction design is also in
	contrast to information architecture - an information
	architect looks at the organization of information to make
	the structure of a complex system easy to conceptualize and
	navigate, but is not usually focused, for instance, on
	low-level interactions. For example, an information architect
	may design the structure of an entire website, but not have
	as much interest in the design of individual pages and how
	users interact with forms and other controls.

prototyping

	[205]
	the development of incomplete representations of a target
	system for testing purposes and as a way of understanding the
	difficulties of development and the scale of the problem.

	Prototyping is an essential element of an iterative design
	approach, where designs are created, evaluated, and refined
	until the desired performance or usability is achieved.
	Prototypes can range from extremely simple sketches
	(low-fidelity prototypes) to full systems that contain nearly
	all the functionality of the final system (high-fidelity
	prototypes).

	Here is a list of some prototyping terms and techniques:

	thumbnail sketch

	rough

	comp

	mockup

	paper prototype

	video prototype

	wizard of oz prototype

	functional prototype

	rapid-prototyping

	RAD tool (rapid application development)

user interface toolkit

	[206]
	a collection of software routines to help build user
	interfaces, typically including routines for input-handling,
	graphics, widgets, error-handling, window management, and so
	forth. These may be built on type of lower-level software
	platforms such as window managers and layout managers.

undo

	[207]
	the facility for reversing the effects of any given
	operation.

	Some common elaborations of undo include:

	redo facilities - for bringing back the effects of an
	operation that was undone

	repeat - repeats an operation instead of undoing it

	multiple undo - allows a user to undo a series of operations,
	not just the most recent one

	selective undo - allows a user to undo any previous operation
	without undoing everything that occurred after it

	hierarchical undo - as a user undoes some actions and
	continues with new actions, a hierarchically-organized set of
	versions is created; these versions may then be accessed and
	navigated to explore variations

	multi-user undo - in a multi-user system, several issues
	arise both from a user-interface and technical perspective,
	e.g. when a user says "undo", should the undo apply to the
	last command by the user who is undoing or should it apply to
	the last command generated by any of the users?

hit logs

	[208]
	statistics on which pages are getting visited on a website,
	useful for determining which pages are popular, which may be
	difficult to find, and which paths people are taking through
	the website.

	The logs may contain information on what date and time people
	are visiting, what domains people are browsing from, which
	browsers they are using, and what pages they are coming from.
	It is also generally useful to separate the number of times
	graphics are loaded, to distinguish between the number of
	visitors and the number of hits (since some people may visit
	multiple times). Hit logs can sometimes be very difficult to
	interpret since hits may not be recorded if people have
	cached a page, and visitors may be impossible to distinguish
	when they share a proxy server (an intermediary that can
	provide caching and anonymity).

website maintenance

	[209]
	long-term support and growth of a website, which may involve:
	adding new materials, adding new | and adjusting the
	organization and navigation, technical support, configuring
	to support new browsers and internet standards, updating the
	look, correcting and updating information, etc.

	A highly-usable website design can easily drift into an
	unusable system as it grows and reorganizes unless
	considerable effort is placed in maintaining and supporting
	that growth. A style guide and usability guidelines can be
	prepared to minimize the drift as the site is updated.

centralized architecture

	[21]
	an architecture for distributed applications, which may
	involve multiple processes and which depends on one central
	process to serialize all events. Serialization is necessary
	to make sure that actions performed by multiple participants
	in a conversation are in a single consistent order, so that
	all participants will perceive a consistent view of the order
	of events.

rapid prototyping

	[210]
	quickly generating mockups of what a system will look like.
	Rapid prototyping may be done with paper prototyping methods,
	such as with quick sketches, or with techniques like video
	prototyping or wizard of oz prototyping. Rapid prototyping
	systems are software systems, such as HyperCard, Director, or
	RAD tools, that let you quickly display interface elements
	and define some behavior for them to obtain a sense of the
	interaction and the capabilities of the fully-implemented
	system. These prototypes are useful for determining the
	target of the development project, doing many types of user
	testing, and spotting unanticipated complexities in the
	design.

storyboard

	[212]
	a series of illustrations that represent a process, such as

	animation or movie. Storyboards are useful for presentations,
	such as with focus groups, and for checking that the steps of
	a process make sense once the details are sketched.

navbar

	[213]
	navigation bar; a group of buttons or hyperlinks that are
	used to navigate through a website or through a set of
	screens. Each button is typically labeled with the title of
	the page it goes to and/or an appropriate icon.

	related: {navigation} {website design}

	categories: <Navigation> <Menus>

navigation

	[214]
	finding things in large or complex information spaces, such
	as on websites. Some ways to help people navigate include:

	showing miniatures or at least links to nearby or related
	areas

	providing a home page or top-level category

	showing navigation bars ("navbars") with | and sub|

	providing overviews or sitemaps

	allowing people to bookmark important locations

	providing information about links ("scent") that might
	indicate their relevance or importance, such as by providing
	a brief description or indicating how many times a document
	matches a keyword

	providing information about which documents are popular or
	have been used recently

gesture

	[215]
	an input method commonly used in pen-based systems -or- a
	physical movement used in communication such as a hand motion
	or a facial expression.

	input method - gestures are pen movements that can be
	recognized as various symbols or commands. For example, a
	circling movement may indicate selection, a zigzag movement
	deletion, or a rapid swipe may indicate scrolling.

	communicative gestures - any body, face, or hand movement
	which is used in conversation to communicate or to reinforce
	what is being spoken. Gestures are particularly relevant in
	synchronous groupware systems such as videoconferencing or
	shared drawing. Videoconferencing systems, for instance, are
	often designed to transfer images of the face and miss out on
	hand gestures. In collaborative applications such as shared
	drawing, objects can be moved to communicate some physical
	gestures, and telepointers communicate other gesture
	information.

menu-driven interface

	[216]
	an interface consisting of a series of screens which are
	navigated by choosing options from lists, i.e. menus. ("Menu"
	is not used here to refer to pull-down menus, but to lists of
	options on the screen that lead to other screens.) Because of
	their simplicity, menu-driven interfaces are commonly used
	for walk-up-and-use systems, such as information kiosks and
	ATMs. Websites are also often designed with the same basic
	navigation principle, where navigation bars substitute for
	"menus".

menu

	[217]
	a set of options to choose from, often presented as a text
	list, but also sometimes as a set of pictures, audio menus
	(for instance, in a voice-answering system), or a set of
	animations or video.

	Pulldown and dropdown menus are the common ones to see on
	computer desktops (WIMP interfaces), where they typically
	appear in menubars. They are primarily used to issue commands
	and set options.

	Menu-driven interfaces are screens with lists of options to
	guide the user to other screens. These types of menus are
	simply lists for navigation and are not typically used to
	issue commands.

anecdotal report

	[218]
	an example stated in detail to demonstrate a point, often in
	narrative format. A case study is also a detailed
	consideration of one example, but in contrast to a case
	study, an anecdote is often one example selected from many
	specifically to provide support for a certain point of view.

	Anecdotes are not generally very useful as evidence to
	support design decisions because of a number of likely biases
	involved. For instance, anecdotes frequently represent
	extreme cases rather than typical cases. Second-hand
	anecdotes may suffer distortion. Anecdotes are also generally
	not a very good way to report results because others can't be
	certain how carefully and responsibly they were selected.

	Case studies can avoid some of the problems of anecdotal
	evidence by carefully documenting how specific cases were
	selected, by establishing careful documentation of how
	observations are collected and recorded, and by reporting
	observations in detail, both those that agree with any
	conclusions drawn and those that disagree.

	categories: <Usability Methods>

single-case experimental design

	[219]
	a method for determining the effect of an experimental
	manipulation with only one test subject (one user, one
	organization, etc.), basically by applying and removing the
	intervention over time:

	measure the dependent variable initially

	apply the intervention, and measure again

	remove the intervention, and measure again

	If the intervention has an effect, then the dependent
	variable should change after the intervention, and return to
	its initial value when the intervention is removed (removing
	the intervention again helps to rule out the possibility that
	something else changed at the same time as the intervention
	which caused the actual effect).

	This technique may be useful, for instance, in testing
	changes to a groupware system being used by a large
	organization. Since it is difficult to find other
	organizations using the same system in the same way, it may
	be difficult to create a control condition.

CSCW

	[22]
	computer-supported cooperative work. The field of study that
	examines how technology affects group interaction, and how
	technology can best be designed and built to facilitate group
	work.

	Despite the name, this field of study doesn't restrict itself
	to issues of "cooperation" or "work", but may examine
	competition, socialization, and play. The field typically
	involves anyone interested in software design and social and
	organizational behavior, including business people, computer
	scientists, organizational psychologists, communications
	researchers, and anthropologists, among many other
	specialties.

declarative graphics system

	[220]
	a software system to support the drawing of graphics through
	specifying the graphic objects that exist and their
	properties without having to specifically instruct the
	computer to draw at any specific time, in contrast to
	procedural graphics where each drawing command must be issued
	explicitly every time the graphics must be redisplayed. A
	declarative graphics system will automatically handle
	clipping graphics to their view, deciding the best order to
	draw graphics, and determining when graphics need to be
	redrawn.

	Declarative graphics systems are at the core of many user
	interface management systems and are particularly useful for
	managing widgets and creating drawing systems.

event handler

	[221]
	a central software routine for applications in graphical user
	interfaces that processes events as they arrive, primarily
	user input such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, but also
	system events such as time-based triggers. The events arrive
	in an event buffer. The events are processed in a cycle
	called the "event loop" where the oldest event in the buffer
	is interpreted and quickly processed, then the event handler
	is revisited for the next event.

shopping cart

	[222]
	a common metaphor used in web-based ordering systems. Users
	search for products, then add them to an abstract shopping
	cart. The entire list of items in the shopping cart is listed
	when they go to an order page to finalize the order.

	The abstract metaphor is mostly necessary because of the
	difficulty of implementing, in a way that is compatible with
	a wide variety of web browsers, a dynamically-updating list
	of selected items for an order that remains visible to the
	user throughout the order selection process.

anchor point

	[223]
	(graphics) the point on an object that remains stationary
	while an object is resized or rotated, for instance, while
	resizing a window or rotating an image within a drawing
	program.

	Similarly, the point at which a selection begins. For
	instance, when selecting text, the anchor point is the point
	at which the user first clicks when dragging to select a
	range of characters.

style guide

	[224]
	a reference that establishes the look-and-feel of a user
	interface by clearly defining the standards and conventions
	of that user interface. Style guides usually include the
	principles that guide the design of the interface, graphic
	layout grids, exact size and spacing of elements in the
	interface, fonts, colors, interactive behavior, standard text
	messages (such as error messages), and labeling standards.

	Excellent style guides are available for most major operating
	systems. Specific style guides are often created for
	individual applications or websites to establish consistency
	in organization and visual standards, and to assist the user
	interface designer in communicating the design both to
	developers and to other designers who may be working on the
	same project in the future.

tear-off menu

	[227]
	a menu that can be made into a window (a floating palette) by
	clicking on it and dragging outside its normal extent until a
	small outline follows the pointer to position the new window.
	This is especially useful if a menu contains extremely common
	commands that a user may want to have ready access to at all
	times, but that some users may not need (so it doesn't need
	to be a window all the time).

auditory I/O

	[230]
	sounds used for input and output, which may include speech,
	musical sounds, naturalistic sounds, and artificial
	waveforms. Sound as output has the advantage of being
	accessible to the visually impaired, of being heard even the
	user needs to be looking somewhere else, and of being
	understood readily for certain types of sounds (e.g.
	well-designed speech). Sound as input is useful for people
	with motor impairments and those who need to use their hands
	for other tasks (e.g. driving a car), and speech can be a
	useful input mechanism to enter a menu selection or even free
	text.

	Sound is intrusive, so it can be heard even when it's not
	attended to, which can be an advantage and a disadvantage.
	Sound can be disruptive in many work environments and may not
	be an effective communication means in a noisy environment.

	a pushpin icon at the top of menus and dialogs that, when
	pinned, keeps them available even after options have been
	chosen or applied (in the OpenLook graphical user interface).

Sticky Keys

	[234]
	a method of typing where modifier keys, such as Shift,
	Control, Command, and Alt/Option, will "stick" down and apply
	to the next keystroke, so that only one key needs to be
	pressed at a time. This is extremely useful for people who

command-line interface

	[249]
	a means of operating a computer by typing a text command at
	an on-screen prompt and hitting the Enter or Return key to
	issue the command. The computer then processes the command,
	displays whatever output is appropriate, and presents another
	prompt for the next command. Typical commands are to run a
	program, enter a text editor, list files, and change
	directories. This mode of interaction is common, for
	instance, in the traditional DOS and UNIX operating systems.

depth perception

	[254]
	the experience of perceiving a third dimension of depth into
	a computer screen. For instance, windows add a certain depth

collaborative drawing

	[261]
	2 or more people conversing with the use of drawings or

	though there exists a continuum between them, such that it's
	difficult to produce a successful collaborative drawing tool
	that doesn't support both to some extent.

	Successful support for this type of collaboration involves
	two primary facilities: helping people avoid collisions
	(where they accidentally interfere with each other's work)
	and providing communication facilities (i.e. direct
	communication tools such as chat and indirect "awareness"

Fitts' Law

	[265]
	T = k log2(D/S + 0.5), k ~ 100 msec.

	T = time to move the hand to a target

	D = distance between hand and target

	S = size of target

	Fitts' Law is a model to account for the time it takes to
	point at something, based on the size and distance of the
	target object. Fitts' Law and variations of it are used to
	model the time it takes to use a mouse and other input
	devices to click on objects on a screen.

	Broadly, Fitts' Law can be applied by designers to suggest
	moving target buttons closer and making them larger for
	extremely commonly used buttons. In detail, applying the
	formula can be extremely useful for exact design of
	time-critical applications.

Hick's Law

	[266]
	(1) H = log2(n + 1).

	(2) H = S pi log2(1/pi + 1).

	H = the information-theoretic entropy of a decision.

	n = the number of equally probable alternatives.

	pi = the probability of alternative i for n alternatives of
	unequal probability.

	The time it takes to make a decision is roughly proportional
	to H, the entropy of the decision (the log of the number of
	alternatives), i.e. T = k H, where k ~ 150 msec.

	This can be used to make a time estimate for how long people
	will take to make a decision in using a user interface, such
	as choosing a menu item, choosing a tool, or selecting an
	item on a navigation bar. Cognitive modeling approaches such
	as GOMS apply this to making predictions of human
	performance.

	Tn = T1 n-a, a ~ 0.4

	Tn = the time to perform a task after n trials.

	T1 = the time to perform a task in the first trial.

	n = the number of trials.

	For instance, the label "bugs" provides a hint that the
	content it labels contains information about insects or
	possibly software bugs (and thus, it has ambiguous scent). It
	does not suggest information about cars or nuclear physics,
	so no one is likely to seek information about those topics
	under that label.

	"Overlapping windows" are the most common in GUIs. They can
	be moved and resized, and windows can be brought forward,
	obscuring windows behind them.

	"Tiled windows" are a way of dividing up the screen into
	panes (as in split windows, or web-browser frames). With
	tiled windows, users have much less control over the position
	and size of the windows, though this may make interaction

task analysis

	[294]
	a set of methods for decomposing people's tasks in order to
	understand the procedures better and to help provide computer
	support for those tasks. The basic approach is to define the
	task and the goal of the task and then to list the steps
	involved. The level of detail in decomposing the steps is
	determined by how the analysis is going to be used.

	Task analyses are useful for making time predictions for how
	long a task will take and for spotting potential errors
	(steps in the process which are extremely difficult or
	confusing). Task analyses are also good for spotting areas in
	a user interface that may have been overlooked or
	oversimplified. A task analysis is a fundamental part of a
	cognitive model of user performance, such as GOMS.

scenario

	[295]
	a design envisionment technique whereby a set of
	representative target users are identified and an outline is
	created of their lives, their goals, their interests, their
	schedules, and their interaction with the system being
	designed. While these descriptions of different target
	populations may be driven by survey and interview data, for
	instance, it is primarily a conceptual, introspective
	technique. Scenarios are often created quite early in a
	design cycle to help identify requirements and, like task
	analysis, to identify necessary features that might otherwise
	have been overlooked. Scenarios make sure that you have a
	specific idea of who the product is targeted at and that you
	have considered the different types of users and how their
	needs and goals may be different.

interview

	[296]
	gathering information about users by talking directly to
	them. An interview can typically gather more information than
	a questionnaire and go into a deeper level of detail.
	Interviews are good for getting subjective reactions,
	opinions, and insights into how people reason about issues.
	Interviews may happen in person or over the phone.
	Interviewers focus on finding an appropriate sample of
	interviewees, making the interviewee feel comfortable, and
	trying to avoid misleading questions or any behavior that
	might encourage a biased response.

	"Structured interviews" are ones with a pre-defined set of
	questions and responses. They are sometimes better than
	questionnaires because thorough response is usually easier
	and because optional avenues of questioning can be explored
	which depend on answers to earlier questions. A structured
	approach can provide more reliable, quantifiable data than an
	open-ended interview, and can be designed rigorously to avoid
	biases in the line of questioning.

	"Open-ended interviews" permit the respondent (interviewee)
	to provide additional information, ask broad questions
	without a fixed set of answers, and explore paths of
	questioning which may occur to the interviewer spontaneously
	during the interview. An open-ended approach allows for an
	exploratory approach to uncover unexpected information, used
	especially when the exact issues of interest haven't been
	identified yet.

	Structured and open-ended approaches may be combined. For
	instance, an interview can begin with structured questions,
	and once the quantifiable data is covered, open up discussion
	with the interviewee into other areas.

	approximates the intended color, but doesn't match it
	exactly.

	However, with some browsers, a non-web-safe color may be
	displayed by replacing the color by the closest matching
	color instead of dithering, or sometimes by displaying a
	faulty color. Some browsers do not use the standard 8-bit
	color palette, but instead choose a "best-fitting" color
	palette to display all the colors on a web page, which can
	defeat the use of web-safe colors.

	The web-safe palette is only important for display on
	machines that have 8-bit color. The vast majority of machines
	today have more color, and so are not sensitive to the choice
	of color palette. Thus, design for this limited palette is
	not as critical as in the early days of the Web.

	lists of principles for user interface design, ranging from
	broad statements such as "be consistent" to extremely
	specific details such as "use an ellipsis (...) at the end of
	a menu item to indicate that the command brings up a dialog

logical punctuation

	[305]
	a recommended approach to placing punctuation where the
	punctuation is logically grouped with the part of the
	sentence it applies to, rather than where arbitrary rules
	imply it should go. For instance, your grammar teachers said
	to put commas and periods inside quotes like this:

	"Reading is fun," said the grammar teacher.

	Commas were originally put inside quotes as an artifact of
	how type was set. Now that text appears on a screen, it makes
	more sense to put it outside the quote:

	"The Web is more fun", says the tech-writer.

	Use punctuation where it makes sense. Use commas to indicate
	pauses, and to reduce ambiguity.

triangulation

	[306]
	the use of multiple methods to provide converging evidence
	toward reaching a conclusion. For instance, if users report
	during interviews that they find a label confusing, and
	during user testing the users show difficulty in
	understanding the same label, then these provide converging
	evidence that the label is in fact a problem.

observational study

	[307]
	watching people's behavior to find patterns and
	design-relevant activities. For instance, observing people
	working in an office environment to determine their work
	processes and computer usage patterns.

	Casual observation can be used to gain a basic understanding
	of a situation quickly and at minimal cost. Systematic
	observation attempts to categorize and quantify observations
	through a structured approach to data collection. Observation
	offers the opportunity for detailed descriptive analysis of
	what people do. Observational researchers are often
	particularly concerned with minimizing observer bias and
	achieving good inter-observer reliability.

	Observation is not a particularly good method in general for
	determining people's opinions and beliefs (instead, use
	interviews and surveys), and is not particularly strong
	evidence for determining why something is happening (instead,
	use an experiment), though in both cases observational
	studies may provide extremely useful insights.

participant observation

	[308]
	observing people by joining them in their activity, e.g.
	working with people in their workplace to see how they use an
	office computer system, playing games at the arcade with
	other game players, or joining a programming team to
	understand the programming process. Participant observation
	is extremely useful for gaining trust with the observed
	people and for developing extremely detailed insights into
	behavior and reasoning in a situation. Participant
	observation has the danger of the observer biasing the
	behavior of the observed and may result in difficult
	conflicts of interest at times for the researcher.

clearly marked exits

	[311]
	a principle that users should be able to easily cancel or
	undo an undesirable operation; essentially the principle of
	reversibility or forgiveness. Examples include:

	a Cancel button in dialog boxes

	an Undo command

	the ability to terminate an ongoing operation with a
	Cancel/Stop button or a keyboard combination such as
	Control-C or Command-period

	clear navigation on a web page to return to a previous page
	or a home page

forgiveness

	[312]
	a design principle that says people should be able to recover
	from their inevitable mistakes. Dialog boxes should have a
	Cancel button. Operations should be undoable. Long operations
	should allow a user to stop them in the middle.

	The most forgiving design is one which helps people avoid
	making mistakes, e.g. with an interaction style that doesn't
	permit inconsistent states. If an operation is not
	reversible, then an appropriate warning should be given
	before an irreversible action is committed to.

reversible actions

	[313]
	any action that can be undone. Reversibility is a design
	principle that says people should be able to recover from
	their inevitable mistakes. Dialog boxes should have a Cancel
	button. Applications should have an Undo feature (and
	possibly multiple undo, and Redo).

	Actions that are not reversible (e.g. saving over a file
	without making a backup) should require a user to explicitly
	commit to them.

aesthetic integrity

	[314]
	a principle that advocates that a design should be visually
	appealing and should follow common principles of visual
	design: consistency, a clear identity, a clear visual
	hierarchy, good alignment, contrast, and proportions, etc.

	What constitutes an aesthetically successful design may vary
	with the application and the audience. A bright and active
	design may work well for attracting people to store-front
	displays, but a softer, more soothing design will be far more
	successful for applications that people need to use all day
	long.

	As with all design principles, aesthetics needs to be
	carefully balanced with other requirements, such as providing
	adequate information when it is most useful and avoiding
	confusing the user.

	Note that aesthetic integrity is not merely "attractiveness".
	It implies a visual design that is coherent and
	well-structured.

concurrent help

	[315]
	help systems that are available alongside an application, not
	overtaking it, so that the user can continue working with the
	application while referring to the content of the help
	system. Balloon help and tooltips are examples where the help
	system is intimately integrated with the application. An
	example of non-concurrent help is a web page which is
	replaced with a help page when a help link is clicked.

critical mass

	[316]
	the number of people who need to be using a system before it
	can be successful; often thought of as the number of people
	contributing in a groupware system to make the value of the
	system to each individual greater than the cost to each
	individual.

	For instance, a group calendar that identifies schedule
	conflicts within a group may not identify sufficient
	conflicts until a large majority of the group is entering
	their schedule into the system.

	Adoption of a system may be influenced by a number of
	factors, such as the degree of cross-platform compatibility,
	whether there exists a motivated group of early adopters, or
	whether their can be an external incentive for adoption (such
	as insistence by customers or management).

participatory design

	[317]
	a democratic approach to design that encourages participation
	in the design process by a wide variety of stakeholders, such
	as: designers, developers, management, users, customers,
	salespeople, distributors, etc. The approach stresses making
	users not simply the subjects of user testing, but actually

clinical trial

	[318]
	testing a system in a clinical setting; that is, in a
	hospital, clinic, doctor's office, etc. User testing and
	feature testing in such an environment has special
	limitations, especially because of the potential for
	unexpected effects on patient care. User testing in clinical
	settings will often require review by an ethics committee to
	ensure that patient privacy is not compromised and that no
	harm will come to patients as a result of testing. As with
	drug testing, it may not be appropriate to remove a feature
	from a system for the sake of testing if it appears that the
	feature is directly benefiting patient care.

groupware

	[32]
	any type of software designed for groups and for
	communication, including email, videoconferencing, workflow,
	chat, and collaborative editing systems.

	This technology may be used to communicate, cooperate,
	coordinate, solve problems, compete, or negotiate. While
	traditional technologies such as the telephone qualify as
	groupware, the term is ordinarily used to refer to a specific
	class of technologies relying on modern computer networks,
	such as email, newsgroups, videophones, or chat.

	Groupware technologies are typically categorized along two
	primary dimensions:

	whether users of the groupware are working together at the
	same time ("realtime" or "synchronous" groupware) or
	different times ("asynchronous" groupware), and

	whether users are working together in the same place
	("colocated" or "face-to-face") or in different places
	("non-colocated" or "distance").

modal

	[320]
	a type of interface where the user moves between different
	states, or modes. In each mode, input from the user is
	interpreted in a different way. When a user is in a given
	mode, it's a good idea to provide an extremely salient
	indicator of which mode is currently active, e.g. by
	providing a large icon or shifting the color of the screen.

	Modes are usually good to avoid because users are restricted
	in their available actions and they may be confused that the
	meaning of their actions changes as they change contexts.
	However, modes can sometimes be helpful to control and guide
	input (providing security and preventing accidental errors),
	and modes may be appropriate when they are short and actively
	maintained by a user (e.g. the fact that keys refer to
	capital letters only when the Shift key is held down) and
	when they follow well-understood conventions, such as
	painting tools.

	Examples of modes include:

	Choosing a painting tool in a paint program. When the Line
	tool is selected, for instance, all mouse clicks create
	lines. When a brush tool is selected, the user is in a
	different mode because all mouse clicks are then interpreted
	as painting.

	Old text processors, such as 'vi' in UNIX, often used a
	command mode and an edit mode. In a command mode, keystrokes
	issued commands. In an edit mode, keystrokes were entered
	into a text document.

	Moving between pages on a website. Each page is a mode which
	limits the kinds of actions a user can take (where they can
	go).

	Modal dialog boxes are ones that force a user to respond to
	them before the user can go back to using other aspects of
	the application.

modeless

	[321]
	a type of interface where the user is free to perform any
	action in the interface and the interpretation of user input
	is the same at all times. That is, mouse clicks always have
	the same effect and keystrokes always have the same effect.
	This is particularly in contrast to modal interfaces, where
	the interpretation of input can vary depending on the current
	state or current settings (the "mode").

	Modeless interfaces are generally preferred to keep a user
	from getting confused by modes, but in some cases modes may
	be preferred. For example, a wizard (or "assistant") is a
	structured series of steps that severely restricts a user's
	actions and can change context with each step, but is helpful
	to the user by providing guidance and limiting otherwise
	seemingly infinite parameters to a comprehensible subset.

teamware

	[323]
	buzzword for groupware generally intended for relatively
	small, cohesive teams, usually used with a business emphasis.
	Group size and cohesiveness are both important factors in the
	design of groupware. Groupware for small groups can be
	technically easier to construct and test. Small groups also
	imply a variety of different software policies. For instance,
	anonymity and privacy are usually less of a concern, and
	designating other group members can be much simpler.

document management systems

	[324]
	systems for entering, tracking, routing, and processing
	documents, whether documents that were originally created
	electronically (email and online forms) or documents that are
	scanned ("imaged documents"). Document management systems
	form a subset of workflow systems, though they may also have
	a separate emphasis without the groupware flavor of workflow
	(that is, more of an emphasis on database capabilities than
	on routing).

	Document management systems may be used to maintain large
	archives (e.g. libraries, legal documents, cancelled checks,
	credit card receipts), as form-processing systems (e.g.
	routing expense reimbursements and employee reviews), or in
	document production systems (such as newspapers and
	magazines).

day-in-the-life studies

	[325]
	an approach to observational studies where one person is
	followed by the observer throughout a typical day and
	everything they do is recorded in order to get a detailed
	understanding of their work processes and work environment.
	By following a person through a whole day instead of skipping
	boring or inconvenient parts, a researcher gets a more
	thorough understanding of relationships and a better
	opportunity to capture fleeting moments than by observing
	during only selected or focused work times.

	A day-in-the-life study offers an excellent source of data
	for a report in the form of a "scenario", a description of a
	typical person in the target population and what their goals
	and schedules are like.

diary study

	[326]
	a study that asks people to keep a diary, or journal, of
	their interactions with a computer system, any significant
	events or problems during their use of a system, or other
	aspects of their working life. A diary typically asks a user
	to record the date and time of an event, where they are,
	information about the event of significance, and ratings
	about how they feel, etc.

	An interesting alternative for making diary entries is to
	give users a tape recorder and a list of questions, so that
	users don't need to write things down as they encounter them.

trending

	[327]
	making predictions about the future based on previous trends
	in order to anticipate the target environment for a design,
	which may differ from the current environment, e.g. by

	competitor actions, market preference changes (fashions),

	to coordinate their work at various points.

distraction

	[329]
	anything that draws a users attention away from their current
	focus or desired focus, usually sounds or moving visual
	displays (such as blinking text, automatically scrolling
	text, animations, and flashing menubars).

	On rare occasions, distractions can actually be useful for
	moving a user's attention to important signals, such as
	warning or error messages (as with a flashing menubar),
	though often they represent design errors by drawing the
	user's attention to low-priority items or over-emphasizing
	items that a user does not always want to attend to. They may
	also happen as the result of conflicting priorities, as in
	the case of distracting banner ads.

	Awareness mechanisms, which are intended to keep the user
	updated on system status and the activities of other people,
	may become distractions when they are too intrusive or when
	the activities they monitor become too intense.

agent

	[330]
	while most software is designed to respond directly to user
	commands, agents are pieces of software designed to act on
	their own. In the background, while users are working, agents
	work in parallel on other tasks: searching for relevant or
	interesting files, looking for bugs, optimizing performance,
	helping users solve problems by anticipating their needs.

domain knowledge

	[332]
	or "subject matter expertise"; knowledge about a specific
	field of interest; knowledge about the content area for which
	a piece of software is being designed, as opposed to
	programming knowledge or usability expertise. For instance,
	when building medical software, physicians and nurses have a
	great deal of knowledge about medical procedures and medical
	terminology.

	User interface designers need to develop as much domain
	knowledge as possible when designing for a specific type of
	task or target audience, but as much as possible, people with
	expertise in the area (domain experts) should be involved in
	the design process.

domain expert

	[333]
	or "subject matter expert" (SME); a person with special

	A truck driver is an expert in trucking and the needs
	truckers have for the types of systems that truckers might
	use, such as delivery or inventory systems. A manager may be
	a domain expert for project management systems. An accountant

affinity diagram

	[338]

	down ideas on a set of cards and then organize the cards by
	grouping them and by placing closely related concepts close
	to each other (e.g. by shuffling the cards on a table or
	pinning them to a wall); especially useful for uncovering the
	structure and relationships in a poorly understood domain.

	brainstorming sessions. Related "card sorting" techniques are
	useful for uncovering similar groupings from users.

card sorting

	[339]
	a technique for uncovering the hierarchical structure in a
	set of concepts by having users group items written on a set
	of cards, often used, for instance, to work out the
	organization of a website.

	For a website, users would be given cards with the names of
	the web pages on the site and asked to group the cards into
	related |. After doing so, the users may be asked to break
	groups again into subgroups for large sites. After gathering
	the groupings from several users, designers can typically
	spot clear organizations across many users. Statistical
	analysis can uncover the best groupings from the data where
	it's not clear by inspection, though inconsistent groupings
	may be a sign of a poorly-defined goal for the website or a
	poor choice of web page names.

	independently and load new pages independently.

	Frames are useful when something needs to be on-screen all
	the time, such as navigation bars or advertising, and may
	sometimes improve download time.

	However, generally frames are not a recommended technique in
	website design for a large number of reasons. Typically they
	result in user confusion from a number of interface problems
	with navigation, bookmarking, printing, and so forth.

	item in the list, which issues a command or selects a

	[345]
	the extent to which software actually helps to solve users
	real, practical problems. A system may be easy to use but not
	relevant to the actual needs of a user. Usefulness depends to
	a large degree on the features and functionality of a system,
	but also on the usability of a system. User interface
	designers prefer to be involved in the design of a system at
	an early stage so that the software requirements are
	consistent with user needs.

redundant modalities

	[348]
	using more than one way to represent, display, and enter
	data, such as:

	using both a beep an a menubar flash to notify a user of an
	error

	using text to label images redundantly

	allowing a user to issue commands by typing or selecting
	something with a pointer

	Redundancy provides flexibility for different user
	preferences, system configurations, or user abilities.

side effects

	[349]
	actions that occur as the result of a user action which do
	not seem to the user to be related to the primary goal of the
	action. For instance, when starting a game changes system
	configurations (such as screen and sound settings) and fails
	to change it back when the game is not being used.

	Side effects should be avoided. They cause particular
	problems for novice users and disabled users who may have
	difficulty detecting or correcting certain types of side
	effects.

CMN-GOMS

	[35]
	Card, Moran, and Newell GOMS. CMN-GOMS adds hierarchical
	structure to the Keystroke Level Model (KLM) version of GOMS.
	Tasks are organized as a series of goals and subgoals and
	operators are organized into subroutines called methods.
	CMN-GOMS can provide task execution times and affords a
	better view of the task structure than KLM.

cone tree

	[351]
	a way of displaying hierarchical data (such as org charts or

	are spread out in a cone. This allows a denser layout than
	traditional 2-dimensional diagrams, though nodes may be
	obscured.

perspective wall

	[352]
	a way of densely displaying large amounts of information by
	placing information on a flat plane which is tilted into the
	screen so that it shrinks back toward infinity. More
	important items (such as upcoming dates on a calendar) can be
	displayed at a closer location and thus appear larger than
	the less important items that are further away. This is one
	example of a general fisheye view approach.

cognitive artifact

	[353]
	a physical object (or software application) used in the
	process of thinking, remembering, and problem-solving. Many
	types of drawings (on paper, whiteboards, and blackboards)
	can support thinking, and many software applications are
	specifically designed to help people solve problems (such as
	spreadsheets). We want to specifically differentiate those
	aspects which are used to help us think from those which are
	used to help format and produce artifacts.

	Examples of cognitive artifacts include:

	remembering with grocery lists and appointment books

	writing and manipulating equations and arithmetic problems

	using a word processor to help us organize our thoughts and
	construct arguments

	using diagrams, such as graphs, schematics, and decision
	trees, to help us understand and reason with relationships

	Many of these items are used collaboratively, where people
	are solving problems together, as conversational props.

mutually exclusive attribute group

	[354]
	a set of items where only one item can be selected at a time,
	such as a group of radio buttons. An example would be a menu
	with font sizes, where a given letter can only have one font
	size, so if another size is chosen, the formerly selected
	size is deselected. This is in contrast to an accumulating
	attribute group (such as a group of checkboxes), where
	multiple items can be chosen.

gaze awareness

	[356]
	the ability to tell what someone is looking at by watching
	the direction of their eyes. In videoconferencing systems,
	gaze awareness may be an important aspect of effectively
	communicating. For videoconferencing, gaze awareness is a
	more relaxed design principle than designing so that people
	can maintain eye contact. Is it important for people to be
	able to see directly into the eyes of the people they are
	talking to, or is it enough that they know that the person
	they are talking to is looking at them (i.e. when the monitor
	displaying the person is not in the same place as the
	camera)?

NGOMSL

	[36]
	Natural GOMS Language. NGOMSL was developed as a formally
	defined version of CMN-GOMS based on cognitive complexity
	theory (CCT). It has a more structured hierarchy than
	CMN-GOMS and a well-defined analysis methodology for
	developing models. In addition to the execution time and task
	structure information provided by CMN-GOMS, its CCT roots
	allow for learning time predictions, as well.

hyperbolic tree

	[360]
	a method of displaying a hierarchy (such as a corporate
	org-chart or a directory structure) of any size within a
	finite area (a circle). The node that is focused on is
	centered, and as you move away from the central node and
	toward the edge of the circle, each node is made
	exponentially smaller. This allows larger representation near
	the focused area while still displaying the overall structure
	of the tree.

focus+context

	[361]
	a principle of information visualization -- display the most
	important data at the focal point at full size and detail,
	and display the area around the focal point (the context) to
	help make sense of how the important information relates to
	the entire data structure. Regions far from the focal point

cognitive psychology

	[362]
	a branch of psychology whose focus on phenomena such as
	learning, memory, perception, and problem-solving lends
	itself well to applications in human-computer interaction.

	Cognitive psychology is often characterized by the common use
	of experimental research methods and formal mathematical or
	computational models to account for behavioral data.

	Some of the best-known contributions in cognitive psychology
	to the design of user interfaces are cognitive modeling
	techniques, such as GOMS, which help predict user behavior
	based on users' perception of the interface, their
	decision-making time, memory constraints, and time to execute
	actions (e.g. based on Fitts' Law). These can be used to make
	predictions of how design decisions will affect user
	performance with a system.

horizontal and vertical prototypes

	[363]
	describes what types of capabilities are implemented in a
	prototype: horizontal prototypes display a wide range of
	features but without fully implementing all of those
	features; vertical prototypes do not attempt to show all that
	will be in a system but instead focus on implementing a small
	set of features in a nearly-complete fashion.

	Horizontal prototypes are appropriate for understanding
	relationships across a broad system and for showing the range
	of abilities of a system.

	Vertical prototypes are most appropriate when a certain
	complex feature of a system is poorly-understood and needs to
	be explored, e.g. as a proof-of-concept.

remote usability evaluation

	[364]
	situations where the user and the usability evaluator are not
	located in the same place, as when users are tested over the
	internet. Remote evaluation is especially helpful when the
	user population is small and specialized, dispersed, or
	difficult to get to geographically (e.g. designing for a lab

CAI

	[368]
	computer-aided instruction; the use of computers in training
	and education. Traditional techniques of computer-aided
	instruction included drill-and-practice programs and
	approaches inspired by artificial intelligence research which
	used models of learning to model errors learners were making
	to customize lessons to the specific needs of the student.
	Somewhat more recent approaches include simulation
	environments for exploratory learning and a focus on
	collaborative learning environments (CSCL).

exploratory learning

	[369]
	an approach to teaching and training that encourages the
	learner to explore and experiment to uncover relationships,
	with much less of a focus on didactic training (teaching
	students by lecturing them). Exploratory learning does not
	necessarily mean an unguided or unconstrained learning
	environment, but does mean that learners may discover
	unexpected lessons and reach conclusions following various
	paths.

	Exploratory learning approaches are considered most
	appropriate for teaching generalized thinking and
	problem-solving skills, and may not be the best approach for
	such things as memorization (though proponents of exploratory
	learning would emphasize that memorization is probably much
	less useful than it is often thought to be).

	Computer support for exploratory learning usually emphasizes
	using computers as tools rather than as teachers. Not only
	may traditional software such as spreadsheets be naturally
	appropriate to the task, but computers also make excellent
	communication devices for co-discovery and make great
	simulation devices for exploring safely in otherwise
	inaccessible domains.

CPM-GOMS

	[37]
	Cognitive Perceptual Motor GOMS. CPM-GOMS is a cognitive
	modeling technique based on CMN-GOMS with an emphasis on
	parallel activities. Where other GOMS techniques assume that
	humans do one thing at a time, CPM-GOMS assumes as many
	operations as possible will happen at any given time subject
	to constraints of the cognitive, perceptual, and motor
	processes. Models are developed using PERT charts and
	execution time is derived from the critical path.

distance learning

	[370]
	learning in an environment where the instructor and the
	student are at different locations. Distance learning may

multiuser

	[373]
	describes any application designed to be used by more than
	one person or to coordinate the activities of multiple users,
	i.e. groupware.

	Some common design issues in multi-user systems include:

	sharing - how information is shared and how sharing is
	indicated for different aspects of the user interface

	security and privacy - the need to protect information and
	the privacy of users

	awareness - providing useful information about other users'
	behavior to help coordination

	session control - managing how multi-user sessions are
	initiated and finalized, and who can participate in a group
	session

videoconferencing

	[374]
	systems permitting people at separate locations to
	communicate via video and audio.

	Some common design considerations for videoconferencing
	systems include:

	desktop vs. conference room - is the system designed for
	personal use or for group meetings?

	gaze awareness and eye contact - can users see where others
	are looking, to help establish rapport and common ground?

	supplemental groupware applications - what other software is
	available during a videoconferencing session (e.g.
	decision-making software, shared whiteboards)?

	privacy and reciprocity considerations - can a one-way video
	connection be established?

	video quality - how large does the image need to be to be
	useful? is a wide-angle lens useful?

	audio localization - in conference rooms, is it possible to
	determine who said what over a video connection?

prisoner's dilemma

	[375]
	a classic problem statement describing a situation where what
	is rational for an individual is in conflict with what is
	rational for the group (as with the commons problem). This
	type of problem is useful for describing problems in
	coordinating the use of groupware systems.

	The Prisoner's Dilemma goes like this:

	two criminals are arrested for a crime and placed in separate
	rooms. Each is given the opportunity to confess or remain
	silent. Each is told the following. If neither of you
	confess, then a minor penalty will apply to both of you. If
	you confess and the other prisoner does not, then you will be
	set free, and he will get a severe punishment. However, if
	both of you confess, then you will both be charged for the
	full crime, though some leniency will be shown because of
	your confession.

	This challenge is typically represented in a table like the
	following. The problem is that individually, each prisoner
	reasons that it is more rational to confess regardless of
	what the other prisoner does. However, from the point of view
	of both of them, it would be most rational if neither
	confessed. Without the opportunity to coordinate their
	actions, they aren't able to achieve the outcome that is best
	for the pair of them.

quality inspection

	[376]
	reviewing a user interface for its conformance to style
	guidelines and specifications, especially with regard to
	required functionality and robustness (frequency of system
	errors) because these have a dramatic effect on usability.
	The purpose of a quality inspection is to make sure that an
	interface is engineered (built) up to the standards of the
	design. It is usually performed toward the end of a
	production cycle, either just before or during alpha testing
	of a product, as well as just before final release.

	the prerequisites for each task, the steps to take for the
	user and the system, and the changes that will be true after
	the task is completed. Use cases are especially useful for

field testing

	[383]
	testing a product in the actual context in which it will be
	used, as opposed to laboratory testing, or testing the
	product in its development environment. Field testing can be
	useful for spotting a wide range of interaction problems such
	as problems with software being incompatible with other
	software on the target systems, odd lighting conditions,
	users with inadequate training, and users whose tasks differ
	from the idealized task analysis.

heuristic evaluation

	[384]
	a technique for finding usability problems with a user
	interface. A small number of trained evaluators (typically 3
	to 5) separately inspect a user interface by applying a set
	of "heuristics", broad guidelines that are generally
	relevant. They then combine their results and rank the
	importance of each problem to prioritize fixing each problem.
	In Jakob Nielsen's work, he identified 10 heuristics which
	are broadly helpful in spotting the vast majority of problems
	(though others may at times be useful). The 10 that Nielsen
	identifies are:

	visibility of system status

	match between the system and the real world

	user control and freedom

	consistency and standards

	error prevention

	recognition rather than recall

	flexibility and efficiency of use

	aesthetic and minimalist design

cognitive walkthrough

	[385]
	an approach to evaluating a user interface based on stepping
	through common tasks that a user would need to perform and
	evaluating the user's ability to perform each step. This
	approach is intended especially to help understand the
	usability of a system for first-time or infrequent users,
	that is, for users in an exploratory learning mode.

	Based on a user's goals, a group of evaluators steps through
	tasks, evaluating at each step how difficult it is for the
	user to identify and operate the interface element most
	relevant to their current subgoal and how clearly the system
	provides feedback to that action.

	based on user preferences, relevance of the information, and
	past information usage. Information filtering is quite
	similar to the information retrieval field, except that
	information is viewed as being sent to a passive user
	(through a broadcast medium) rather than being actively
	sought after by the user. Information filters may operate on
	a publishers/broadcasters behalf or on a user's behalf as an
	intelligent agent. A key consideration is to help the user
	avoid information overload. The key problem, shared with the
	information retrieval community, is determining the relevance
	or importance of a given chunk of information.

programming by demonstration

	[396]
	systems that allow a person to construct a program simply by
	demonstrating the actions that the program needs to perform.
	The system then must infer what loops and conditionals might
	be involved, and may allow the user to select among several
	candidate programs that attempt to generalize the users
	demonstrated task into a program. This works well for very
	simple tasks and may even work quite well in specialized
	domains where meaningful inferences can easily be made, but
	programming by demonstration certainly will not be replacing
	traditional programming for large-scale programs.

forms-based programming

	[397]
	programming by filling out a set of forms that query a user
	about the types of inputs and results they want. Forms-based
	approaches are useful in specialized domains which do not
	require the full power and generalization of a traditional
	programming language.

	Forms-based programming is one type of end-user programming,
	allowing users to create reasonably complex programs without
	having studied programming.

end-user programming

	[398]
	programming that is done by a software user who is not a
	programmer, presumably without any specific training in
	programming. The idea is to make the power of computers fully
	accessible to all users so that they are not limited to the
	capabilities of the software they are provided, and to do
	this by creating a user interface to programming which makes
	programming easier.

	Many approaches to end-user programming have been tried,
	including many macro languages and scripting languages. Some
	common approaches include:

	visual programming - providing a visual interface to
	programming, such as with dataflow diagrams, flowcharts, or
	screen-layout systems

	natural-language syntax - making the programming language
	look more like a spoken human language (e.g. Cobol and
	HyperTalk tried this strategy)

	forms-based programming - using forms and dialogs (such as
	wizards) to create a program

	programming by demonstration - letting users perform their
	tasks and inferring programs that correspond to them

programming by example

	[399]
	similar to programming by demonstration, a user provides
	examples of how a program should operate, either by
	demonstrating the steps or by showing examples of the inputs
	and outputs, and the system infers a program that would
	achieve those examples. This type of system is intended to
	enable users without programming expertise to construct
	software.

call control

	[4]
	same as session control; the mechanism for determining who is
	involved in a call (session) and for setting up the call. A
	call is the term used most frequently for telephone sessions.
	The term session is used more often in order not to confuse
	"call control" issues with simple phone call issues. Some
	typical call control issues:

	How many people can be in a call?

	Are there restrictions on who can be in a call (e.g. security
	limitations)?

	Who can initiate a call?

	How do callers locate other people? How are directory
	services handled?

	How are calls initiated? Does everyone have to independently
	connect to a central location (as in a chat room)? Does the
	call get connected as soon as a caller identifies a call
	recipient? Does a call recipient get buzzed?

	Are callers identified?

human-computer interaction

	[40]
	a diverse scientific and applied field where the focus is on
	how people use computers and how computers can be designed to
	help people use them more effectively.

	The subject is studied from a wide variety of perspectives
	from many diverse areas, including (among others): computer
	science, psychology, ergonomics, information sciences,
	graphic design, sociology.

	Example HCI topics include: design tools, design methods,
	human information processing, collaborative work, information

psychology of programming

	[400]
	the study of how programmers create software, including such
	topics as learning a programming language, planning a
	program, how language features affect coding time and
	accuracy, and how programmers isolate and repair bugs.In
	addition to understanding basic principles of human
	cognition, the psychology of programming can help design
	better programming languages and programming environments.

progressive disclosure

	[401]
	the design principle that says to show overviews and hide
	details until the user requests more detail, and then to
	provide only the additional level of detail required.

	This principle is often used in file systems and outlines, as
	with the disclosure triangle in Mac OS or the + symbol in
	Windows interfaces. Many dialog boxes will have a "More
	Options" or "Expert Options" feature to provide additional
	information or controls. These features allow a user to focus
	on the most important information first and then refine their
	task progressively.

Meyer's Law

	[402]
	T = A + B * SQRT(D/W)

	T = time to move to a target

	D = distance to target

	W = width of target

	A ~ -13 msec

	B ~ 108 msec

	Meyer's Law is a refinement of Fitts' Law for predicting the
	time it takes for rapid aimed movements, such as hitting a
	button on the screen by moving a mouse to it. (A and B are
	constants which may vary with the input device.)

	Meyer's Law is derived from a stochastic
	optimized-submovement model. This model says that movements
	consist of a primary submovement and a possible corrective
	secondary submovement toward a target.

	Meyer's Law can be used to make predictions of how much time
	it will take for a user to accomplish a task involving
	selection of targets on the screen (such as icons, menus, or
	hypertext links).

analytic memo

	[406]
	a brief note used during the coding and construction of data
	that summarizes a possible interpretation or analysis of the
	data. Memos help to remember particular analyses and focus
	future data collection and coding to explore ideas in the
	memos.

	Analytic memos are used most often in qualitative
	observational approaches, such as ethnography or contextual
	inquiry, but they can be useful in the process of essentially
	any type of research. Some other types of memos may also be
	considered, though the boundaries between them blend: a
	"theoretical memo" considers possible theories that the data
	may support; an "integrative memo" seeks to identify
	relations between different pieces of data.

	including how people use computers in their work or play.
	Artifacts may be examined from any number of perspectives,
	including where the objects are, how many there are, their
	functional role, their conversational role, their physical
	characteristics, or their flexibility of use through
	different situations.

	Artifact analysis may be used to supplement observational
	data and to gain a more thorough understanding of people's
	tasks, and may lead to the design of improved artifacts.

video coding

	[409]
	or video transcription; the systematic recording of the
	contents of recorded video. While coding may note any number
	of characteristics in the video, typical coding involves a
	text transcript of words spoken and who is speaking,
	indicating such things as pauses and overlapped speech.
	Depending on the goals of the transcription, video may also
	be coded for such things as gestures, drawings, use of tools,
	speaker position, volume of speech, eye contact, etc.

information retrieval

	[41]
	the field of study that examines how people find information
	and how tools can be constructed (such as search engines and
	catalogs) to help people find information. Studies examine
	how the organization of information affects its retrieval,
	the types of searches people do, the kinds of search queries
	people can make effectively, and what determines the
	relevance of retrieved information.

out-of-box experience

	[410]
	OOBE; the interactions and first impressions a user has with
	technology when first opening the box it comes in and
	installing it, as opposed to the point-of-sale experience or
	the interaction experience of an expert user.

	The out-of-box experience affects one of the potentially most
	difficult and stressful interactions a user will have with
	the product, when the least is known about the product's
	capabilities and interaction style. It can also be one of the
	most likely points at which a user will call customer
	support, so that improvements in this experience may result
	in significant cost savings in customer support and reduction
	in customer complaints.

event-driven interface

	[411]
	the kind of interface common to most modern operating systems
	where the user can initiate actions at any time -- the system
	responds to user "events", such as typing, mouse movements,
	or mouse clicks. This is in contrast to the formerly common
	command-line interface, where users typed an entire command,
	hit Enter, and waited for the computer to complete the
	operation before entering another command.

focus ring

	[413]
	a ring surrounding a default button in a dialog box, used to
	hilite the button and indicate that the button will be
	activated if the Return or Enter key is hit. In many dialog
	boxes, the focus can be moved, for instance, by hitting the
	Tab key. This moves the focus ring to other selectable items
	in the dialog box, indicating that they accept keyboard
	input. This allows expert users to make selections more
	quickly in a dialog box using the keyboard and not a pointing
	device.

legacy system

	[414]
	an old hardware or software system which is generally
	out-dated in some way, either based on obsolete hardware or
	using an older user interface (such as a character-based
	interface). The term is usually used when planning a new
	system to replace or extend the legacy system.

	For legacy systems, two issues generally concern user
	interface designers. First, will a new system really provide
	a better user interface than the legacy system? That is,
	switching from a character-based interface to a graphical
	user interface will rarely improve the usability of dedicated
	software without also doing task analysis and user testing to
	ensure improvement. Second, how will users' experience with
	the legacy system affect their training time to learn the new
	system? What degree of similarity to the legacy user
	interface is appropriate in the newly-designed interface?

cross-platform compatibility

	[415]
	interoperability or platform-independence; the ability for
	devices or software applications to work with more than one
	hardware platform or operating system. Broad compatibility
	with various systems is critical to having a large market for
	a product (reaching your entire user audience).
	Interoperability is important in achieving a critical mass of
	users, especially in groupware and other internet
	applications, where two or more people interacting will
	require some level of compatibility in order to communicate
	or share data.

individual differences

	[416]
	people vary in a number of ways that can have an impact on
	the design of a user interface, and rather than trying to
	design for "the average user", it is often better to
	understand how people vary to design acceptably for a broad
	audience. Sometimes this may even mean designing separate
	user interfaces for different user populations, such as when
	extremely simplified drawing programs are made for young
	children versus sophisticated versions designed for graphic
	design professionals.

	Some of the main | of variations that are of interest to
	designers are:

	user experience level - how well users know their subject
	domain, computing skills, internet skills, ...

	user preferences - users will choose settings according to
	their own tastes and work practices

	market segment - such as age, gender, education, occupation,
	hobby, and income level

	variation in ability - users often have relevant physical or
	cognitive limitations; for instance, near-sightedness and
	color blindness are extremely common, and these can usually
	be easily addressed when a designer is aware of the issues

comparative study

	[417]
	a study whose purpose is to compare 2 or more products, such
	as a user testing comparison to make sure that a new version
	of a product has fewer problems than the prior version.
	Another type of comparison is a competitive analysis to see
	which of 2 products is superior.

	A comparative study might best be considered in contrast to a
	criterion test, where a single product is tested against some
	absolute criteria of usability. For instance, a criterion
	test might be used to confirm that "a user can start up this
	application in 10 seconds or less", whereas a comparison
	might show that "version 3 of this software starts up 50%
	faster than version 2".

internationalization

	[418]
	or i18n (the letter "i" followed by 18 letters, followed by
	"n"); the design or modification of software for an
	international audience.

	Three approaches to internationalization are common:

	globalization: making a monolingual interface more accessible
	for non-native speakers and international use. For instance,
	to make a website more accessible, use straightforward
	language avoiding jargon, make sure phone numbers include
	international country codes, and convert measurements to
	international units.

	multi-lingual interfaces: allow users to choose a translation
	into their own language.

	localization: customize the user interface for each local
	region in which it will be used, by using the local language
	and taking advantage of local conventions, assumptions, and
	common defaults.

information architecture

	[42]
	the organization of information; the field which studies how
	to organize information most effectively to help people find
	and use the information. For instance, how should websites be
	organized? What is the best way to design website navigation?
	How should pages be labeled and identified?

graceful flow

	[422]
	a design principle which advocates that a user's experience
	in interacting with a computer should involve a smooth and
	graceful dialog. In terms of the user's task, this means that
	response time should be rapid and user errors and error
	recovery should be rare. The "flow" refers to the movement
	through a user's task, and needs to proceed from one step to
	another without confusion and with minimal need for difficult
	planning of the following steps.

	When "graceful flow" refers to the text in the interface, it
	suggests that readers should be able to read from one item to
	another without boredom and without pausing to try to make
	sense of the text or of an unusual transition.

persuasive computing

	[424]
	or "captology"; the use of computing technology to change or
	influence attitudes or behaviors. Examples include
	advertising, public service messages, and demo and
	attract-mode screens used for point-of-sale displays and
	arcade games.

	Many important ethical issues need to be considered in this
	context. For instance, as with medical interventions, we
	would hope that our persuasive interventions are both safe
	and effective. That is, are we having the intended effect or
	causing some unanticipated side effect? Is our intended
	effect even an appropriate one (e.g. in advertising, are we
	creating a desire that will actually be good for the
	individual affected)? Are we coercively manipulating people
	(e.g. changing their behavior against their better judgment,
	as in the subliminal suggestion debate)?

	Persuasive Technology.)

chromostereopsis

	[425]
	a phenomenon of visual perception: different wavelengths of
	light focus at slightly different depths in the eye. Thus, it
	is difficult to focus on an image that combines two colors
	because each color is fuzzy when the other color is in focus.
	This is especially a problem for images with red and blue.

	This problem can be avoided by creating an image without both
	colors side-by-side, by using black or white boundaries, and
	by increasing the contrast (difference in brightness) between
	the two colors.

artificial intelligence

	[430]
	"AI"; a field of study which examines how to perform
	high-level thinking on computers. Artificial intelligence
	research is typically associated with domains such as speech
	synthesis and recognition, language translation, image
	recognition, and strategy and planning. AI research is also
	associated with certain types of algorithms (such as
	inference engines), data representations (such as
	blackboards), and general models of thought (such as
	connectionist networks).

	Usability issues are critical in many AI systems, where a
	human works with the system to work out and apply results (as
	in language translation systems and expert systems), and when
	the AI system serves as the user interface for the user (as
	with speech systems). AI also is applied in some systems to
	build a computer model of the user, which is then used to
	help anticipate the user's needs and optimize the interface
	(as in computer-aided instruction systems and adaptive
	systems).

	AI is part of the field of cognitive science. Approaches to
	AI typically seek to build systems that can act intelligently
	in one way or another, often taking approaches modeled on
	human cognition, but not constrained to a human model. This
	contrasts with the field of cognitive psychology, which seeks
	to create computational models of human cognition
	specifically to build a more complete understanding of human
	cognition.

	The term "artificial intelligence" is misleading to the
	extent that, to begin with, we really don't have a good grasp
	of what "intelligence" is. Human intelligence is often
	considered to be characterized by those properties of thought
	that are not demonstrated by other animals, such as language,
	long-term planning, symbolic manipulation, reasoning, and
	meta-cognition. However, arithmetic, for example, which is
	unique to humans, is nevertheless not considered to be the
	proper domain of artificial intelligence.

	The most common criterion considered for evaluating whether a
	computer has achieved human intelligence is the Turing test.
	In the Turing test, a person communicates via a text terminal
	with two hidden conversational partners: another human and a
	computer. If the person cannot distinguish between the human
	and the computer, then the computer would be considered to be
	behaving intelligently. However, numerous problems with this
	definition of intelligence exist. For example, in practice,
	when this test is applied, humans are often mistaken for
	computers, indicating that we don't really have a good sense
	of what we mean by considering a human to be intelligent in
	the first place!

sccs

	[432]
	source code control system or version control system (vcs) or
	revision control system (rcs); a software application
	designed to help coordinate document modifications and
	updates among a group of people (especially coordinating
	updates to software source code). Source code control systems
	are an example of asynchronous groupware systems.

	Each person who wishes to modify source code "checks out" the
	code, which notifies others who wish to access that code that
	it is currently being modified. Once the change is made, it
	is "checked in". Versions are tracked so that it is possible
	to revert to previous versions of a document. The system also
	conveniently handles large sets of documents and frequently
	handles contingencies between them. Some systems include the
	ability for multiple people to modify the same document at
	the same time (but independently) and then to resolve
	differences once the documents are merged.

stress testing

	[433]
	or "try-to-destroy-it" testing; testing the limits of a
	system based on the range of possible human interactions.
	Stress testing is especially appropriate to systems being
	used under extreme conditions: in public kiosks, unusual
	climates, for users who are unusually preoccupied (as in
	cars) or unusually stressed (in emergency rooms).

	Testing may consist of trying to break the machine, by seeing
	how difficult it is to crash the application or break the
	security, by testing input devices to see how much punishment
	they can take. For instance, how well does a mouse or
	joystick react to extreme force or repeated rapid movement?
	(such conditions may be common with public kiosks).

	restricted to asynchronous groupware features, and not
	real-time communication capabilities.

anonymity

	[435]
	the ability to participate in interactions with other people
	without being identified. Anonymity can be at various levels,
	including hiding a person's name and other characteristics,
	such as age and gender; from simply making their name
	accessible but nonobvious, to helping to make sure that the
	person is entirely untraceable, and that no identifying
	information about them is ever available.

	Anonymity can be useful for protecting people's privacy and
	security. Anonymity can also help people participate in
	conversations without fear of reprisal (helping to encourage
	open and honest discussions) and with less concern for being
	stereotyped based on their identity or characteristics.

	Anonymity creates potentials for abuse. While on the one
	hand, it can protect people from targeted harassment, it can
	also protect people who harass from being identified. It can
	create security problems, and is inappropriate for certain
	security situations. It also causes problems in situations
	where someone needs to take responsibility and be held
	accountable, as in cases where people's safety is involved.

privacy

	[436]
	the principle of protecting private information about people,
	especially in shared or collaborative systems, and of helping
	to keep people free of distractions. Privacy may be provided
	for security reasons, to keep people (such as celebrities)
	from being deluged with people contacting them, or to simply
	allow people to protect personal information from being
	shared with others (for whatever reason).

	In many systems, privacy is in tension with a legitimate
	desire to share information to help people coordinate (as in
	'awareness' systems). Ethical concerns need to guide how we
	decide what information to make available and how. One
	example is the principle of reciprocity, which says that
	people can not find information about you without making the
	same information about themselves available to you. Of
	course, the principle of reciprocity alone is not sufficient.
	Another concern is that people sometimes need to share

PIM

	[437]
	personal information manager; a software application designed
	to help people manage personal information, such as
	appointments, contact lists, notes, and reminders, and often
	integrated with email/messaging systems. Their user
	interfaces are distinguished by the relative lack of
	structure to the data, the speed with which users need to
	store and retrieve information, and usually a very strong
	desire for the data to be portable with the user, as in a
	pen-based device.

data mining

	[438]
	the use of statistical and visualization techniques to
	uncover trends and relationships within massive databases.
	Data mining is common with financial data, medical data,
	census data, and across the web as a whole. The trends sought
	after are often non-obvious and require substantial data
	manipulation, either through a directed search to test a
	particular hypothesis or through less bounded exploration to
	find unexpected results.

access privileges

	[439]
	based on a person's identity or the identity of their group,
	access privileges define what capabilities or features are
	available to them when they access a system, what files they
	can read or write, what programs they can run, what other
	users they can interact with, and so on.

	Access privileges provide a level of security, preventing
	users from tampering with aspects of the in which system they
	don't belong. Access privileges also allow a system to
	provide customized interfaces to users based on their roles
	in group interactions.

user testing

	[44]
	a family of methods for evaluating a user interface by
	collecting data from people actually using the system.

	A simple user test would be to bring in a small number of
	potential users of the software (perhaps 8 to 10) and have
	each person sit down and use the software to perform a series
	of tasks while an observer takes notes about what
	difficulties each user encounters. Typically, users are asked
	to think out loud while they work with the software to help
	the observers understand how the users think about their
	problems and how the interface could be improved.

	More involved user testing may test more users, get as
	representative a selection of users as possible, try out a
	variety of tasks, control the testing environment in various
	ways (or test a more naturalistic work environment), use more
	careful or thorough measurement instruments (videotaping,
	recording keystrokes, etc.), or combine the testing with
	other methods of data collection, such as interviews of
	users.

user interface critique

	[440]
	or u.i. critique; an expert evaluation of a user interface in
	the tradition of literary criticism. At least in a casual
	sense, this is the evaluation technique most often used in
	software reviews: an expert reviews the software from any of
	a variety of perspective and using a variety of methods,
	usually somewhat related to usability inspections, but
	without the rigor of formal methods. Reviewers usually allows
	their biases and opinions to play a role in guiding the
	evaluation, though responsible evaluators will usually make
	their biases explicit when appropriate.

	As in literary or film critiques, a user interface critique
	may come from any number of theoretical perspectives,
	including historical, psychological, sociological, ethical,
	philosophical, economic, and artistic concerns. Deeper
	criticisms are often meant to be part of a long-term dialogue
	with society about the various impacts of our design
	decisions. Practical critiques are often intended simply for
	quickly improving our design of software and improving our
	purchasing decisions, based on the practical expertise of the
	critic, and in a more cost-effective fashion than most formal
	evaluation methods.

accountability

	[441]
	the principle that in many multi-user situations, someone
	must be identifiable in order to take responsibility for
	actions or for decisions. In these cases, anonymity is not
	always effective or achievable (though users may be anonymous
	to other users while identifiable to the system).

	Someone usually needs to be accountable when safety or
	security issues are prominent, or when financial commitments
	must be made. Usually, users must be identifiable enough in
	order to be held accountable in any situation where someone's
	rights may be violated. Accountability needs to be handled
	carefully to ensure that users can still maintain an
	appropriate level of privacy in their use of a system.

information overload

	[442]
	a state of having too much information, such that a person is
	overwhelmed. When information is available in enormous
	quantities (as on the web) and not clearly structured, people
	have difficulty finding relevant information and grasping
	important principles embedded in the information. Under such
	circumstances, various techniques for organizing the
	information or helping people navigate within the information
	space include information visualization, information
	filtering, and principles such as "focus + context".

flowchart

	[443]
	a visual way of representing a task or procedure,
	traditionally used by programmers to visualize the flow
	within their programs. Steps of a process are represented in
	boxes and flow is represented by arrows connecting the boxes.
	Input and output are typically represented in skewed
	parallelograms, and decision points are usually represented
	with diamonds. Flowcharts generally do not scale well to
	extremely large processes, and they mostly fell out of use as
	a programming tool with the advent of structured programming
	techniques, which minimized the use of complicated branching
	structures in software.

	categories: <Information Visualization> <Programming Tools>

intuitive

	[444]
	a term used loosely to refer to user interfaces that are easy
	to understand without training. An interface may sometimes be
	intuitive due to some inborn perceptual skill (e.g. loud
	noises make us pay attention) or at least some common
	physical characteristics of the world which anyone would be
	familiar with (e.g. raised surfaces facilitate, or "afford",
	pushing, while lowered surfaces do not). However, much of the
	time, an interface is only "intuitive" to the extent that it
	is familiar, or similar to some previous experience of the
	user, and this perspective is often the most useful for
	understanding what makes a design most successful -- imitate
	familiar activities, objects in the world, or software that
	people already have experience with.

inter-observer reliability

	[445]
	or inter-coder reliability; the degree to which 2 observers
	record the same data (or in some cases, draw the same
	conclusions) in the same circumstances. Lack of reliability
	in observations can indicate that observers are missing
	important details, that they are not categorizing
	observations in the same way, or that what appeared to be
	similar circumstances are actually not. Reliability is
	critical when design decisions are being made based on
	observations, and critical for allowing researchers to
	effectively communicate about their findings.

chrome

	[446]
	a visual style for user interfaces that presents widgets as
	beveled 3-dimensional objects, usually with a gray, metallic
	appearance. In this style, buttons are presented as raised
	rectangles, text-entry fields and other content areas usually
	appear in beveled insets, and bumps and parallel ridges are
	often used to indicate that something is draggable.

	Also, the "chrome" of an interface refers to the area of the
	interface taken up by controls, as opposed to the content
	area of the interface.

instant messaging

	[447]
	IM; a technique of sending a message: the sender specifies
	the recipient and typically types a simple text message; the
	recipient has a window pop up automatically that displays the
	short message. This differs from email in that the interface
	is usually designed only for short messages and because the
	message is intrusive - it interrupts whatever the recipient
	is doing, whereas an email usually arrives in the background
	and is viewed at the recipients leisure. An instant message
	differs from chat systems in that the recipient does not
	explicitly start the application and the communications are
	private.

candy box

	[448]
	in website design, a small box or sidebar that may appear
	anywhere within a page that hilites interesting tidbits,
	quotes, small ads, asides, or chunks of related navigation.
	Often it is a small graphic used like a banner ad and that
	looks like a button.

	categories: <Business and Marketing> <Website Design>

intrusiveness

	[449]
	the property of a perceptual signal that enables it to draw
	attention from other activities. Perceptually, a sound or a
	bright flash can draw attention from people even when they
	are attending to something else. This property is useful for
	such applications as emergency warnings or to attract people
	to events of high importance or short duration. For instance,
	a ringing phone draws someone's attention so that they'll
	pick up the line before the caller hangs up.

	On the other hand, in many situations intrusive signals can
	interfere with a higher-priority primary task. In those
	situations, most people want to turn off intrusive signals
	that don't indicate emergencies, for instance, by turning off
	their phone ringer.

	Paying attention to which types of signals can be intrusive
	(audio, flickering media, speech, animations, large changes
	in the visual field, touching), we can help the user control
	when and how they wish to be interrupted and avoid
	distracting them with unnecessary signals.

	In the non-perceptual domain, many interruptions of work,
	such as spam email, are viewed as intrusive, to the extent
	that people cannot avoid the way in which those activities
	interfere with their desired activities.

readability

	[450]
	the degree to which the meaning of text is accessible, based
	on the complexity of sentences and the difficulty of the
	vocabulary that is used. Readability indexes usually rank
	usability by the age or grade level required for someone to
	be able to readily understand a reading passage. Note that
	readability should be contrasted with legibility, which
	indicates how clear the text is visually.

	related: {legibility}

	categories: <Design Philosophy> <Word Processing/Writing> <Typography>

legibility

	[451]
	the clarity of visually-presented text, affected for instance
	by the size of the text, the contrast between similar
	letters, the quality of printing or display (whether the text
	is damaged or blurred), the line-spacing and word-spacing,
	and the shape and style of individual letters.

	Legibility is distinct from "readability", which indicates
	how easy it is to understand the text, provided that it can
	be read.

empirical methods

	[452]
	any of a large number of methods which are based on
	measurement -- in user interface design, this usually means
	measuring the activities of people as they use computer
	systems. This specifically does not include theoretical
	methods, analytic methods, usability inspection, prototyping,
	and graphic design methods. General classes of empirical
	methods include:

	experiments and quasi-experiments, including many types of
	user testing

	observational approaches: contextual inquiry, ethnography

typography

	[453]
	the design of letterforms, and the selective use of
	appropriate type (in appropriate fonts) for the display of
	text. Typographers often specialize in the design of fonts
	and of logos, but typography plays a role in any context in
	which text is displayed. Type is often selected for its
	style, mood, rhythm, and legibility. Typography also
	encompasses the layout of text: size, orientation, alignment,
	spacing (leading and kerning), and margins.

	Typography plays an important role in usability by affecting
	the legibility of the text (and thus the speed and comfort of
	reading), by providing appropriate emphasis, and by
	establishing the flow of eye movement through written
	material.

simplicity

	[454]
	the principle that user interfaces should be "simple" for
	users. Simplicity is used loosely to refer to the need to
	minimize the number of steps involved in a process, to use
	symbols and terminology that make the interface as obvious as
	possible, and to make it difficult to make mistakes.

consistency

	[455]
	the principle that things that are related should be
	presented in a similar way and things that are not related
	should be made distinctive. Consistency applies across quite
	varied contexts:

	information should be presented in a consistent way: if bold
	is used to provide emphasis in one part of a document,
	italics shouldn't be used in another part

	input and output should be consistent (stimulus-response
	compatibility): pressing an up button should go up, not down

	an application should behave consistently in any context and
	on any platform (cross-platform compatibility)

	what one person sees should be consistent with what another
	person sees, so that they can effectively communicate about
	it (the WYSIWIS principle)

	an application should behave consistently with the metaphor
	that it presents: folders on a desktop may contain files, but
	files may NEVER contain folders

explicit destruction

	[457]
	a design principle that suggests that anytime information is
	permanently deleted (or for that matter, any irreversible
	action is performed), the user should be required to
	explicitly indicate that the deletion/destruction is actually
	desired. This is important when deleting files, writing over
	files (e.g. saving over an old version), or whenever data
	will be permanently lost. This principle is often violated in
	database systems, where, for the sake of efficiency, data is
	overwritten as soon as a user moves to a new record, even
	without explicitly acknowledging that the previous data
	should be lost. The principle of explicit destruction is
	related to the forgiveness principle, which suggests
	minimizing irreversible operations so that users can explore
	without fear of destroying any information.

desktop metaphor

	[458]
	the representation of familiar desktop items in a user
	interface to help make the capabilities of a computer clear.
	The prototypical example is the Macintosh desktop which is
	used as a backdrop for all application windows and the
	surface on which files are manipulated. Files are organized
	into folders, and other objects including disks and printers,
	appear as icons on the background desktop. Traditionally, the
	Mac included "desk accessories", including a calculator,
	notepad, scrapbook, and clock, that correspond to items a
	person might have on their desk. This organizing metaphor
	presumably makes new users more comfortable with the system
	and helps them to learn more quickly how to interact with it.

	measuring or comparing the ease-of-use of a computer system,
	including: usability inspection, user interface critiques,
	user testing of a wide variety of kinds, safety and stress
	testing, functional testing, and field testing. Usability

	a design tradition preceding human-computer interaction and
	strongly related. Ergonomics is often used relatively
	synonymously with "human factors". It studies how to design
	human-machine systems with a concern for human needs,
	especially focused on work environments, efficiency, and
	safety. The field has a strong engineering flavor, with an
	emphasis on measurement of human performance parameters and
	physical properties, such as the measurement of human
	dimensions to determine the size and arrangement of desks and
	chairs, or the application of psychophysical parameters to
	set noise levels.

human-machine interface

	[461]

	electro-mechanical system that a person interacts with, used
	most often to refer to hardware as opposed to software
	interfaces. The HMI is the collection of knobs, levers, and
	monitors that a technician would use on an industrial system

	design, eliminate unnecessary steps and alternatives in order
	to achieve efficiency, reduce decision time, and reduce
	errors caused by following incorrect paths. Write concise,
	factual text that is directly relevant to the user. Minimize
	imagery in layout that is not directly used in communicating

	used to force users to view advertising, read important
	announcements, establish their identity, provide information
	for customization, or read a sequential narrative (as when
	establishing a scenario before beginning a game). However,
	such a tunnel is usually best to avoid when it is not

collaborative writing

	multiple people composing text together. Collaborative
	writing systems may provide both realtime support and
	non-realtime support. Word processors may provide
	asynchronous support by showing authorship and allowing users
	to track changes and make annotations to documents. Authors
	collaborating on a document may also be given tools to help
	plan and coordinate the authoring process, such as methods
	for locking parts of the document or linking
	separately-authored documents. Synchronous support allows
	authors to see each other's changes as they make it, and
	usually needs to provide an additional communication channel
	to the authors as they work, such as videophones or chat.

usability testing

	same as user testing, but emphasizes that it is the property
	of being usable, not the user, that is being tested.

	Usability testing encompasses a range of methods that examine
	how users in the target audience actually interact with a
	system, in contrast to analytic techniques such as usability
	inspection. In a typical approach, a user performs a variety
	of tasks with the application while an observer records notes
	on how successful the user is in performing each task: how
	fast users go, what mistakes they make, where they're
	confused, what solution paths they take, how many learning
	trials are involved, and so forth.

	techniques, are:

	requirements gathering: field studies, interviews, focus

	resistance to applied force, e.g. viscosity. Applied to
	keyboard keys and the feel of resistance they give, and
	appropriate to all interactions where the interface resists
	change, lags in response, or dampens the magnitude of the
	input (e.g. an icon that won't move until it is dragged some
	minimum distance from where the user first clicks on it).

safety

	[473]
	minimizing the risk of harm to people or the environment.
	Possible types of harm include physical harm (repetitive
	stress syndrome, electrocution), mental anguish (lack of
	privacy, negative self-attributions), and threats to property
	(fraud, vandalism).

	Safe systems attempt to minimize both the maximum harm that
	is possible and to provide robustness to minimize the
	probability that a harmful result will occur. This is
	achieved by developing error-tolerant systems and designing
	user interaction sequences that reduce the possibility of
	human error.

	part of the context in which user interface design takes
	place is the need for any design to satisfy not only the
	user's goals but also the goals of the business producing the
	application, goals such as profitability and marketability.
	If a design does not have an appropriate business case, then
	it cannot succeed in the market even if it is extremely
	usable.

speed-accuracy tradeoff

	[475]
	in many types of perceptual-motor tasks, there is a tradeoff
	between how fast a task can be performed and how many
	mistakes are made in performing the task. That is, a user can
	either perform the task very fast with a large number of
	errors or very slow with very few errors. When asked to
	perform a task as well as possible, people will apply various
	strategies that may optimize speed, optimize accuracy, or
	combine the two. For this reason, comparing the performance
	of 2 users cannot be done on the basis of speed or accuracy
	alone, but both values need to be known.

	Under some testing situations, people can be instructed to
	optimize either speed or accuracy, and they will effectively
	adopt the appropriate strategy. However, results can be
	extremely hard to compare, because time differences between a
	person who made zero errors and a person who made one error
	can be dramatic. For this reason, in situations where a
	speed-accuracy tradeoff exists, the relationship between
	speed and accuracy needs to be mapped out.

link rot

	[478]
	because websites are frequently appearing and disappearing
	(and moving to new addresses), some fraction of links to
	outside websites will become invalid links over time. The
	slow degeneration of a web page with many links, due to the
	occasional link that becomes invalid, is known as "link rot".

	Avoiding link rot requires mechanisms of detecting dead links
	and updating them if they have moved. This maintenance can be
	extremely costly, encouraging many designers to be very
	cautious about creating links to websites not under their
	control and especially those that are not viewed as being
	stable, permanent addresses.

	documents and other services are available on the internet.
	This address is universal in the sense that it works for a
	wide variety of internet services, including web pages
	(http:), ftp sites (ftp:), email (mailto:), gopher sites
	(gopher:), newsgroups (news:), etc. It also works from any
	location, and does not depend upon the network route between
	the two computers that are communicating (as some other
	addressing schemes do).

email

	[48]
	by far the most common groupware application (ignoring of
	course, the traditional telephone). While the basic
	technology is designed to pass simple messages between 2
	people, even relatively basic email systems of today
	typically include interesting features for forwarding
	messages, filing messages, creating mailing groups, and
	including files with the message. Other features that have
	been explored include: automatic sorting and processing of
	messages, automatic routing, and structured communication
	(messages requiring certain information).

domain name

	[480]
	a name interpreted by internet software to determine which
	computer (which server) to access. For instance,
	diamondbullet.com is a domain name representing the company
	Diamond Bullet Design and which is translated by internet
	software to an IP address indicating the specific computer

homepage

	[481]

	compelling and at the same time provide enough information to
	a user to identify the purpose and uses of the website, as
	well as guiding users to appropriate subpages.

search engine

	[488]
	a tool that allows a person to enter a word or phrase and

	phrase. The success of such a search depends on a variety of
	factors including: the number of websites that are searchable
	(or scope of the database), the syntax that a user enters a
	query in, and the algorithm for determining the "relevance"
	of a result, which is some measure of how well a given page
	matches the query. A typical problem is a user retrieving too
	few or too many results and having difficulty broadening or
	narrowing the query appropriately.

newsgroups and mailing lists

	[49]
	similar in spirit to email systems except that they are
	intended for messages among large groups of people instead of
	1-to-1 communication. In practice the main difference between
	newsgroups and mailing lists is that newsgroups only show
	messages to a user when they are explicitly requested (an
	"on-demand" service), while mailing lists deliver messages as
	they become available (an "interrupt-driven" interface).

Java

	[490]
	a cross-platform object-oriented general-purpose programming
	language. Java can be embedded within a web page to provide a
	very flexible user interface. Java is not to be confused with
	JavaScript, an essentially unrelated scripting language that
	can be used within a web page, but provides extremely limited
	capabilities, especially with regard to input and output.

cognitive impairment

	[491]
	any limitation in the ability to think or reason that affects
	a person's capacity to perform a task. Cognitive impairments
	can be congenital or the result of a head injury, stroke, or
	disease. Head injuries in particular can result in very
	localized damage, producing highly-specific problems. Many
	cognitive impairments are quite common, such as attention
	difficulties and dyslexia.

	Because cognitive impairments span such a wide range of
	problems, there are really no broad solutions in interface
	design that help everyone, though general usability
	recommendations that help reduce cognitive load for everyone
	will often provide some benefit, in particular: minimize the
	load on working memory, simplify tasks, organize interfaces
	to minimize error, be forgiving and allow users to undo
	mistakes. Cognitive impairments are often less observable and
	well-defined than other types of impairments, so it is
	helpful to consult a doctor or learning specialist to help
	clarify the exact nature of the impairment.

	contain options (equivalent to a set of radio buttons, but
	taking less screen real estate) rather than commands, and
	they typically display the currently selected menu option
	rather than the menu title, which usually appears beside the
	popup.

pluralistic walkthrough

	[493]
	a method of usability inspection where a diverse group of
	stakeholders in a design are brought together to review the
	design, including user interface designers, users,
	developers, and management. The walkthrough is conducted by
	identifying primary tasks for the system and stepping through
	those tasks, identifying usability problems along the way.
	The purpose of bringing together various stakeholders is that
	each one brings a certain perspective, expertise, and set of
	goals for the project that enables a greater number of
	usability problems to be found.

cost-effectiveness evaluation

	[494]
	a comparison of the cost of implementing a new information
	system or upgrading an existing one to the costs that would
	be involved in retaining the existing way of doing things
	(i.e. the legacy system or the non-computerized approach). A
	new system does not always represent an improvement. For
	example, upgrading an old character-based user interface to a
	graphical user interface may not provide a more usable
	interface and may not save time or cost.

cost-benefit analysis

	[495]
	a comparison of the cost of a new system to the benefits of
	its use. This helps to evaluate the value of adopting new
	computer equipment and also to evaluate the merits of
	performing usability analyses and redesigning a user
	interface. User interface design efforts need to accomplish
	business goals, which frequently means that the efforts need
	to result in greater income or reduced costs, at least
	indirectly, and a cost-benefit analysis can help to clarify
	the contribution.

critical incident analysis

	[496]
	critical incidents are events that represent significant
	failures of a design, such as when a user accidentally
	unplugs the computer by kicking the power cords under the
	desk or when a nuclear powerplant goes critical because an
	operator thought that turning a dial clockwise meant cooler
	instead of hotter. Critical incident analysis is basically a
	multiple case study technique. A set of observed critical
	incidents are documented and analyzed to determine the source
	of the failure (though sometimes critical successes might
	also be examined). This can hilite the importance of
	improving a very infrequent but important task that otherwise
	might get ignored by a standard task analysis.

productivity paradox

	[497]
	why is it that, despite adopting cool new technology, many
	businesses do not achieve higher productivity? That's the
	productivity paradox. The systems were intended to improve
	productivity, but they didn't. Why not? In general, it stems
	from a failure to evaluate user needs, develop user-centered
	system requirements, drive the design around shared user and
	business goals, and evaluate solutions to make sure that they
	actually satisfy the intended goals.

80/20 rule

	[498]
	a principle for setting priorities: users will use 20% of the

	of your design and development effort (80%) on the most
	important 20% of the product.

consistency inspection

	[499]
	a quality control technique for evaluating and improving a
	user interface. The interface is methodically reviewed for
	consistency in design, both within a screen and between
	screens, in graphics (color, typography, layout, icons), text
	(tone, style, spelling), and interaction (consistency of task
	steps and command names). Of course, consistency shouldn't be
	carried too far: things that need to be distinguished should
	be distinct.

information visualization

	[5]
	the study of how to effectively present information visually.
	Much of the work in this field focuses on creating innovative
	graphical displays for complicated datasets, such as census
	results, scientific data, and databases. An example problem
	would be deciding how to display the pages on a website or
	the files on a hard disk. Visualization techniques include
	selective hiding of data, layering data, taking advantage of
	3-dimensional space, using scaling techniques to provide more
	space for more important information (e.g. fisheye views),
	and taking advantage of psychological principles of layout,
	such as proximity, alignment, and shared visual properties
	(e.g. color).

workflow systems

	[50]
	software allowing documents to be routed through
	organizations through a relatively-fixed process.

	A simple example of a workflow application is an expense
	report in an organization: an employee enters an expense
	report and submits it. A copy is archived then routed to the
	employee's manager for approval. The manager receives the
	document, electronically approves it and sends it on. The
	expense is registered to the group's account and forwarded to
	the accounting department for payment.

	Workflow systems may provide features such as routing,
	development of forms, and support for differing roles and
	privileges.

quality assurance

	[500]
	QA or quality control; ensuring that the results of your
	processes have high quality, measured my minimization of
	flaws in design and production and by product success and
	customer satisfaction. Quality assurance can be implemented
	throughout a design process (not just at the end), not only
	through following the standard recommended processes, but by
	making sure those processes have
	review/verification/validation phases associated with them.
	All designs can be double-checked for correctness,
	conformance to standards, consistency, cost-effectiveness,
	conformance to project requirements, compatibility, safety,
	usability (through user testing), and so forth.

	a design review to determine whether a user interface design
	conforms to standards, whether broad industry standards,
	corporate standards, or standards specifically designed for a
	given project (e.g. conformance to a style guide).

	Standards may include such issues as screen layout, fixed
	processes, response-time requirements, configuration of a
	display, wording in dialog boxes, spelling, and accessibility
	to different user communities.

foot pedal

	[502]
	or "mole" (an underground "mouse"); an input device that is
	controlled by a person's foot, useful for entering boolean
	values (up or down) or values along a continuous range. Foot
	pedals are common in cars, pianos, and sewing machines. From
	driving experience, they are generally quite familiar to
	users. The most likely place you'll find them in a computer
	interface is for driving games in a video arcade.

adaptive interfaces

	[503]
	user interfaces that change over time, in response to how
	they are used, to improve the quality of the interaction.
	Examples with current technology include speech and
	handwriting recognition systems that improve the accuracy of
	their recognition as they become familiar with the user's
	style.

	Adaptive systems also include those that detect common user
	tasks and make these tasks more accessible -- making lists of
	recently-opened files is a very simple example of this. Any
	adaptive interface has, at some level of detail, a model of
	the user's behavior that is refined, and provides an
	interaction that fits the behavior as best as it can.

automatic evaluation

	[504]
	a method of measuring the usability of a system
	automatically; that is, the usability is tested by a software
	application rather than manually, by a person.

	Some types of automatic evaluation do not involve users at
	all. For instance, some types of standards inspections can be
	performed automatically, as in an HTML-checking tool that
	tests for cross-platform compatibility or a dialog-layout
	tool that verifies spacing and alignment properties. A
	computer can also simulate human interaction sequences (mouse
	clicks, text entry) to test a product's robustness. By
	supplying the computer with a user model, such as a set of
	goals, tasks, and ways to perform those tasks, a system can
	be profiled for completeness and to detect likely sources of
	user confusion.

	Other forms of automatic evaluation include using logging
	tools to capture user interaction data and using online
	feedback forms to capture user impressions and automatically
	provide summaries of those responses.

cascading stylesheets

	[505]
	CSS; a method for specifying the look of a web page
	independent of the markup of the structure of that page.

	The original intent in HTML markup was to specify the
	structure of a page and allow the individual user to
	determine how that structure should be displayed. Thus,
	marking something with the H1 tag indicated it was a
	header, but would not specifically indicated how headers are
	formatted, i.e. at a certain font size, spacing, and
	indentation. This approach worked fairly well in the early
	days of the web while the users were researchers sharing
	information about their organizations and research with each
	other. This approach also works fairly well for making web
	pages accessible to those who have visual impairments because
	a browser can be created to present the same information in a
	non-visual mode.

	However, the web quickly became a commercial tool, and was
	soon used for marketing, entertainment, and challenging
	communication tasks that required significantly more control
	over the format of the presentation. The initial temptation
	was to skip the use of "semantic" tags like H1 that
	only indicate the meaning of what they tag and instead use
	"formatting" tags like B (bold) and font (for
	choosing a font) to get the exact effect required. Because
	this would mean losing the semantic information in the
	document, users have less control, the document becomes less
	accessible to the disabled, and automatic processing of
	documents by computer programs becomes more difficult.

	As a result, cascading style sheets were created. They allow
	the HTML programmer to specify that semantic tags like
	H1 have a preferred appearance (font, size, color,
	spacing, etc.). They also allow multiple documents to share
	appearance specifications, permitting the change of
	appearances to be much simpler.

halo effect

	[507]
	(graphics) the glow that appears around an antialiased image
	when it is placed over a background color that is different
	from the background used when making it antialiased. This
	occurs for gif images, which allow transparency, but only for
	an individual pixel to be either 100% transparent or not, not
	for instance, 50% transparent. Thus, when transparent,
	antialiased gif images need to be created, they need to be
	created on a background that is the same color or a near
	color to their final destination background color.

antialiasing

	[508]
	drawing graphics with smooth blends of colors along edges to
	avoid sudden shifts of color between pixels and give a
	smoother appearance. When a line is drawn on a computer
	screen, the common way to draw it in the early days was with
	black and white pixels on a grid -- the line thus had jagged
	edges. Antialiasing is a method for drawing the line using
	intermediate gray pixels to smooth it out. Antialiasing can
	be used for any graphic shape and is used to render letters
	also (sometimes called "font smoothing").

	Unsmoothed, or aliased, images have sharp corners called
	"jaggies". Removing those corners with intermediate colors is
	called "smoothing", "dejagging", or "antialiasing".

design rationale

	design rationale is important for validating that the correct
	design decision was made, to help those who are trying to
	interpret ambiguous design decisions or examples that don't
	fall clearly within a design principle, and to avoid going
	back and changing design decisions without knowing the
	original reasons in the first place. A design rationale can
	be an important tool in arriving at the initial design
	decision in the first place. Rationale should give advantages
	and disadvantages of a choice and include rejected
	alternatives (so that those alternatives don't keep popping
	up for reconsideration).

	schedules conflict for people or finding a meeting time that
	will work for everyone. Group calendars also help to locate
	people. Typical concerns are privacy (users may feel that
	certain activities are not public matters) and completeness
	and accuracy (users may feel that the time it takes to enter
	schedule information is not justified by the benefit of the
	calendar).

	used pejoratively, eye candy may be appropriate for certain
	entertainment and marketing applications, but is generally an
	inappropriate approach to graphic design. A more appropriate
	approach is to focus on a user's tasks and goals and design
	the visual layout to support them as well as possible. This
	is compatible with creating aesthetically-pleasing solutions,
	but the aesthetic approach needs to be guided by the critical
	goals of the interface.

	that a user would perform with an application and the
	features of the application that would be used to perform
	those tasks. Each feature is then evaluated for whether it is
	understandable, useful, and actually available to the user
	when needed. This approach emphasizes the importance of
	functionality to achieving usability. This approach also
	avoids feature creep by emphasizing the appropriate set of
	features and by prioritizing them in the critical tasks.

binocular display

	[516]
	also stereoscopic display; a display that is composed of 2
	separate displays which are directed separately to the left
	and right eyes. The viewpoint is slightly different for each,
	reflecting the slightly different view each eye would have
	when embedded in a 3D scene, thus allowing for a sense of
	depth. Binocular displays are used in virtual reality systems
	and any 3D system for which depth cues are especially
	important. Because the displays are usually up close to the
	eyes, they often also extend across a wider visual angle in
	the eye, allowing for a greater sense of realism, and in the
	extreme, allowing for the use of peripheral vision.

live dragging

	[521]
	visibly moving an object as it is being dragged; for
	instance, moving a slider knob as someone drags it, instead
	of simply moving the outline of the knob (which is called a
	ghost indicator).

screenshot

	[522]
	or screendump / screen snapshot / screen capture; a picture
	of a screen capturing the appearance of the user interface at
	a given point of time, typically a printout, but also
	including electronic snapshots.

	Screenshots can be used for focus groups, like other types of
	mockups, and for some types of user testing, where the
	emphasis is on static rather than interactive features of the
	application.

	Screenshots can also be used as a means of getting users to
	capture their interaction experiences without the presence of
	an observer. This can be used in conjunction with standard
	diary studies. A user can capture typical activities or
	critical incidents, such as times when the application is
	confusing or an error occurs.

command key

	[524]
	or Apple key; a key on the Macintosh used as a shortcut to
	issue commands, by holding down the command key and pressing
	another letter. The command key is usually labeled with a
	small cloverleaf symbol on the Macintosh. The commands are
	typically items in menus that are marked with the cloverleaf
	symbol and the associated key. The command key is used in a
	similar way as the control key is used in some systems to
	indicate commands, though the control key has had numerous
	other interpretations as well. Sometimes abbreviated "CMD".

control key

	[525]
	CTRL; a key on used as a shortcut to issue commands (such as
	menu commands) and to type in certain non-alphanumeric values
	by holding down the control key and pressing another letter.
	The control key has been around a long time and taken on a
	lot of meanings, making its use often confusing. CTRL-C was
	an extremely common key combination for many years to
	interrupt the currently running application. However, on
	today's systems it often refers to the Copy command.

toggle key

	[528]
	a key on the keyboard that toggles between two modes. The

	appear as capitals when it is activated. Other common toggle
	keys include NUM LOCK (alternates between the numeric keypad
	used for numeric entry and using it for cursor movement) and
	SCROLL LOCK (used to stop a screenful of information from
	scrolling past, which is not a common problem with modern
	interfaces).

cursor key

	[529]
	a key on the keyboard that moves the cursor position up,

	often simulated with the numeric keypad used to move the
	cursor, or some key combination used to indicate cursor
	direction.

video communications

	[53]
	systems that allow two-way or multi-way calling with live
	video, essentially just a telephone system with an additional
	visual component. Primarily because of cost (but also
	compatibility problems), early use of video systems was
	primarily in advance-scheduled videoconference meeting rooms.

	Video is advantageous when visual information is being
	discussed, but may not provide substantial benefit in most
	cases where conventional audio telephones are adequate. In
	addition to supporting conversations, video may also be used
	in less direct collaborative situations, such as by providing
	awareness of activities at a distant location.

	moving upwards through a hierarchy of screens or stopping the
	execution of a program. Also used to break out of a command
	mode (where typing issues commands to the software) and back
	into an editing mode (where typing indicates that letters
	should be inserted at the insertion point).

use what you build

	[532]
	a way of evaluating a system by having the designers and
	programmers actually apply the system in their own work. This
	is a particularly good approach for finding functional holes
	and major inefficiencies, and results in great responsiveness
	to user difficulties. However, it runs the risk of not
	incorporating the needs of novice users or being blinded to
	the variable needs of other work environments.

user-extensible systems

	[533]
	software that allows users to add functionality, usually by
	allowing the user some level of scripting capability, but
	also by allowing the user to add resources (extensions,
	fonts, images, etc). Unix shells often allow users to add
	commands by writing scripts. Many programs, such as
	Photoshop, allow users to create macros that are incorporated
	in the application from then on. Web browsers not only allows
	plug-ins to be added, but are extensible in the way that they
	allow bookmarks to be added and organized.

objects-and-actions design methodology

	[534]
	an approach to interface design based on analyzing the task
	domain: determine what data (objects) needs to be manipulated
	and what functions (actions) can be performed on that data
	without consideration of how the interface needs to look or
	behave. After this analysis is done, it forms a consistent,
	structured basis for creating the user interface. This
	analysis can be represented in a simple matrix with objects
	along one dimension and actions along another, which helps
	examine the consistency of how actions are performed across
	objects.

property sheet

	[535]
	a form containing a set of attributes and values for a
	selected object and allowing those properties to be modified,
	often displayed as a dialog box or palette. A typical example
	is a property sheet for text properties, which allows the
	user to specify font, style, size, alignment, spacing, and so

mixed state

	[538]
	a condition in which an indicator must simultaneously display
	2 values; common in property sheets, in property controls
	such as font style, when the property is shown for multiple
	selected objects with different property values (e.g. in a
	text selection, when one character is bold and another is
	plain).

responsiveness

	[539]
	the degree to which a user perceives a system as reacting
	quickly to user input. Responsiveness is not the same as
	speed. Slow systems can be perceived as highly responsive if
	they consistently provide quick feedback to users. This can
	be achieved by processing input and providing feedback in
	parallel with other system processing, or of course, by using
	a really fast system.

chat

	[54]
	software that enables multiple people in realtime to write
	messages in a public space, usually in typewritten text. As
	each person submits a message, it appears at the bottom of a
	scrolling screen.

	Chat groups are usually formed by having a list of chat rooms
	to meet in. Rooms may be identified by name, location, number
	of people, topic of discussion, and so forth. Many systems
	allow for rooms with controlled access or with moderators to
	lead the discussions. Almost all of the interesting issues in
	realtime groupware are manifested in direct ways by chat
	rooms, including issues of anonymity, following the stream of
	conversation, scalability with number of users, and abusive
	users.

	While chat-like systems are possible using non-text media,
	the text version of chat has the rather interesting aspect of
	having a direct transcript of the conversation, which not
	only has long-term value, but allows for backward reference
	during conversation, and which makes it easier for people to
	drop in a conversation and still pick up on the ongoing
	thread of discourse.

	any means of providing a faster method to accomplish a task
	than the general-purpose method, such as assuming typical
	default values. Shortcuts can be provided for experts that
	novices might have difficulty using, such as inconsistent
	methods for common tasks, or ways of issuing commands that
	require memory for those commands (e.g. keyboard accelerators
	as a method to access menu commands).

QWERTY keyboard

	[541]
	the standard North American keyboard layout (pronounced
	KWER-TEE), named for the first 6 letters that appear along
	the top-left row. Primary alphabetic keys are arranged in
	three rows as follows:

	QWERTYUIOP

	ASDFGHJKL;

	ZXCVBNM,./

	The layout is thought to have been purposeful to prevent
	typing from being too fast and thus prevent jamming on early
	typewriters. The most popular alternative is the Dvorak
	keyboard, which was intentionally designed to allow typing to
	be as fast as possible.

Dvorak keyboard

	[542]

	fast. Primary alphabetic keys are arranged in three rows as
	follows:

	',.PYFGCRL

	AOEUIDHTNS

	;QJKXBMWVZ

	Unfortunately, learning to touch-type is time-consuming, and
	thus it has been impossible to replace the entrenched QWERTY
	standard despite the fact that expert typists are much faster
	on Dvorak keyboards.

paddle

	[546]
	a small round input device that a user can spin clockwise or
	counterclockwise (either mounted, or usually held in the
	opposite hand). The direction and speed of movement, rather

see-and-point interface

	[547]
	a user interface that displays objects and options, and a
	user only has to point to (and click on) the relevant object
	to issues commands and perform tasks. See-and-point
	interfaces are in contrast to remember-and-type interfaces
	that do not have all the capabilities visible at once, but
	rather require the user to type commands and filenames known
	by memory in order to perform tasks.

autosave

	[548]
	a software feature that saves the file periodically while the
	user works on a document. Usually a user would need to
	explicitly save a file and risk forgetting to. The user would
	lose data if the application fails (e.g. during a power
	outage) and the user hasn't saved. Autosave has the risk on
	the other hand, of overwriting previous versions of a file
	and preventing a user from reverting without saving changes.
	For this reason, the autosave feature often allows backups to
	be made automatically, may query the user before each save,
	and can allow a schedule to be determined for when it saves.

	Another model for saving data is common in database systems
	-- persistence. Persistent systems never require the user to
	save the data explicitly, but save the data whenever a
	sufficient chunk of data is modified.

	categories: <Miscellaneous>

case sensitivity

	[549]
	whether an application distinguishes between phrases based on
	whether the letters are upper case or lower case. If the
	distinction is relevant, then the system is case-sensitive.
	Otherwise, it is case-insensitive.

	In search engines and in search-and-replace systems, case
	insensitivity is often the default. Thus, if you type "hci,"
	you will still be able to find the word "HCI." Sometimes
	however, you'll prefer to set the system to be
	case-sensitive, for instance, when you want the country "US"
	to be distinguished from the pronoun "us."

	Another common domain in which case sensitivity is relevant
	is command-line interfaces and programming languages.

decision support systems

	[55]
	software designed to facilitate decision-making, particularly
	group decision-making. Decision support systems may provide
	tools for such things as brainstorming, critiquing ideas,
	putting weights and probabilities on events and alternatives,
	and voting. Such systems enable presumably more rational and
	evenhanded decisions. Usually designed as part of tools to
	facilitate meetings in general, they encourage equal
	participation by, for instance, providing anonymity or
	enforcing turn-taking. They may also provide tools such as
	decision trees to help analyze the structure of the decision
	being made.

screen font

	[550]
	a font designed for legibility when displayed on a computer
	screen (or, for example, on a television screen) as opposed
	to a "printer font", which is optimized for printing. Screen
	fonts need to be designed for clarity on the relatively low
	resolution of a monitor, by spacing close parallel lines,
	making sure that serifs don't connect and give the impression
	of closed forms, avoiding lines that are too thin to render
	on the screen, and so forth.

green screen

	[551]

schedule chart

	[552]
	a diagram used in project management, planning, and
	scheduling. The schedule chart shows the different resources
	and activities involved in a project and time dependencies
	between them. With this diagram, a critical path can be found
	that indicates the shortest time that the project can be
	completed in based on viewing the longest activities that
	must be completed sequentially.

	The schedule chart is useful in task analysis and is a
	central aspect of the CPM-GOMS approach to cognitive

	viewed as containing computers and where the computer is
	often viewed as an invisible component. Examples of places
	embedded computers might be found include cars, microwaves,
	toasters, refrigerators, and showers. Embedded systems pose
	unique design challenges because users interact with these
	systems in very different ways than traditional desktop
	operating systems, often expecting an interaction style
	appropriate to the unique task domain and application of the

select-then-operate paradigm

	[555]
	an approach to direct manipulation user interfaces where a
	user must first select an object (icon, piece of text) and
	then choose an action to perform on that object (copy, make
	it boldface, print). This is the typical approach used in
	word processors and graphical file systems (choose a file
	icon, and then drag it, open it, or duplicate it).

	An alternative approach is to choose the operation first and
	then the objects to operate on. This is common in drawing
	interfaces, where a tool (the operation) is selected first,
	and then the tool acts open each object or region it is
	clicked on.

grammar analysis

	[558]
	an approach to analyzing interaction sequences by writing
	grammar-style rules to describe them and then checking those
	rules for consistency and simplicity. For instance, a simple
	set of grammar rules for text editing might include:

	Modify-Text -- Select-Text + Choose-Operation

	Select-Text -- Select-Insertion-Point or
	Select-Text-Range

	Select-Insertion-Point -- mouse-down + mouse-up

	Select-Text-Range -- Click-and-Drag or Double-Click

	Click-and-Drag -- mouse-down + move-mouse + mouse-up

	Double-Click -- mouse-down + mouse-up + mouse-down +
	mouse-up (must be within a specified time interval)

	Choose-Operation -- choose-menu or Enter-Text

	Enter-Text -- enter-alphanumeric-text or hit-delete-key
	or keyboard-shortcut

	The assumption is that fewer and more regular rules represent
	a system that is easier to learn and use. The grammar rules
	may be specified at various levels of detail. Here
	enter-alphanumeric-text was treated as an input primitive,
	but it could also be broken down to the next level of detail,
	e.g.:

	enter-alphanumeric-text -- [0..9] or [a..z] or [A..Z]

	The grammar rules may also specify actions that the computer
	performs or constraints on the applicability of the rule by
	adding annotations.

grid

	[559]
	(graphic design) a system of templates used as a framework to
	create a document with uniform layouts between pages while
	still allowing each page to adapt to its content. The grid
	defines positions for standard elements on the page, margins,
	proportions, spacing, and edges along which elements will be
	aligned.

	(computer graphics) in drawing software, a grid defines a
	series of visible or invisible, horizontal and vertical,
	uniformly-spaced edges for easy alignment of elements on a
	page. Autogrid features force all mouse input on the drawing
	surface to fall along those edges.

commons problem

	[56]
	a problem in group behavior where what is best for an
	individual will actually be harmful for the group as a whole.

	If a village has a Commons area for grazing cattle then this
	Commons area can be a strong benefit to the community so long
	as everyone uses the Commons with restraint. However,
	individuals have the incentive to graze as many cattle as
	possible on the Commons as opposed to their on private
	property. If too many people send too many cattle to the
	Commons, the Commons is destroyed, and the whole village is
	worse off as a result. There are a couple straightforward
	solutions to the Commons problem: an appropriate fee can be
	charged for each head of cattle or a limit can be imposed to
	the number of cattle any individual may bring. These
	solutions are an appropriate starting point for solving
	problems of abuse in groupware.

learn mode

	[562]
	a state in which the computer is "learning" by observing the
	user's behavior. The term is often used to refer to the
	period when a macro is being defined by having each action
	the user performs added to the macro, also called "record
	mode".

	In more powerful programming-by-demonstration systems, the
	user's actions can be generalized to more complicated scripts
	involving loops and conditionals. The hard part in doing this
	is determining which user actions must be performed exactly,
	and which are merely meant to be instances of more general
	concepts: a parameter to the procedure or a conditional
	action that depends on the current computer state.

screen real estate

	[573]
	the amount of space available on a display for an application
	to provide output. Typically, the effective use of screen
	real estate is one of the most difficult design challenges
	because of the desire to have as much data and as many
	controls as possible visible on the screen to minimize the
	need for hidden commands and scrolling. At the same time,
	excessive information may be poorly organized or confusing,
	so effective screen layouts must be used with appropriate use
	of white space.

collaborative inquiry

	[574]
	Inquiry is the investigation of users and their context in
	order to understand their problem space, their goals, and
	associated design constraints, usually by observational
	methods, surveys, and interviews. Collaborative inquiry
	involves the users (or potential users) of an application in
	the investigation, relying on them as collaborators for their
	domain knowledge and appreciation of user needs.

gap analysis

	[575]
	the analysis of the difference between a technology's
	capabilities and the user's needs. This is usually informed
	by a user needs analysis (usually the result of user
	observation and requirements analysis) and is used to produce
	usability objectives and a development plan.

user needs analysis

	[576]
	uncovering the goals a user has and the capabilities needed
	from a technology to assist the user in meeting those goals.
	This involves understanding the target audience, their
	typical tasks, and their specific constraints, usually
	through a combination of observational techniques, including
	interviews, surveys, artifact analysis, and consulting with
	domain experts. The results provide user interface
	objectives, system requirements, and feature requirements.

business rules

	[577]
	statements specifying constraints and relationships between
	components of a user interface. For example:

	The Age field may not be less than zero (a constraint on a
	numeric field widget).

	When the Credit Card Expiration Date is less than Today's
	Date, the Credit Card Expiration Date will be displayed in
	red, and the Submit Order button will be displayed in its
	unavailable state (a relationship between different user
	interface components).

	Business rules are meant to be a design specification written
	in plain language. They often accompany dialog box and simple
	form specifications.

pointer jumping

	[579]
	when the pointer automatically moves around to the most
	likely place you'll want to click next, such as moving the
	pointer over the default button of a dialog box as soon as
	the dialog appears. This shortens the average amount of time
	needed to perform common operations. However, it can lead to
	more frequent errors (clicking the incorrect button) and can
	disorient a user when the pointer moves suddenly.

ALV architecture

	[58]
	abstraction-link-view architecture. A technique for building
	software by developing the application as a user interface
	(the View), the abstract data and semantics (the
	Abstraction), and a set of relationships between these parts
	(the Links).

	This technique makes it easy to add many different types of
	views onto one abstraction, useful in particular for the
	construction of multi-user interfaces, but also useful for
	building debugging systems and for software engineering in
	general enabling user interfaces and underlying applications
	to be developed relatively independently.

	The ALV architecture is similar in spirit to
	model-view-controller (MVC). ALV differs from MVC in 2
	primary ways:

	ALV is based on a constraint system to manage consistency
	between the abstraction and view. The links are a special
	kind of constraint that can create and destroy objects as
	well as maintain relationships between their values.

	ALV combines input and output in the view, whereas MVC
	separates input and output in the view and controller.

mouse-button binding

	[580]
	the association of a button on a mouse with a specific
	functionality, such as the association of a specific tool
	with the left mouse button after that tool has been selected
	in a toolbar. Mice range in the number of buttons they have:
	1 to 3 buttons is common. While the left mouse button is
	typically used to select items and press on-screen buttons,
	the middle and right buttons are often bound with different
	behaviors. Common behaviors that buttons are bound to
	include:

	extending a selection

	displaying contextual menus (commands that are specific to
	the item or area clicked)

	performing a constrained operation, such as drawing straight
	lines when the primary button can draw arbitrary lines

	displaying system commands

trash can / recycle bin

	[583]
	an icon on the computer desktop that represents a container
	for deleted files. (Note how the idea of putting your trash
	can on top of your desktop violates the metaphor of an office
	desktop.) Files are dragged to the trash can to be delete.
	The trash can may be opened to view recently deleted files
	that haven't yet been permanently deleted. The recycle bin
	metaphor may be slightly more accurate than the trash can
	metaphor because it indicates that the file space will be
	reclaimed for use by other files, though this distinction may
	be too subtle for typical users to notice.

usability problem tracking

	[584]
	similar to bug tracking, this is keeping a problem list of

light pen

	[588]
	an input device for selecting regions on a screen or drawing.
	Light pens are generally held up to the monitor and determine
	their position by detecting the timing of the monitor refresh
	at their location. Because of the need for a user to hold an
	arm up to a monitor, typically light pens are not practical
	for long-term use. Thus, most current pen devices are
	designed for drawing on a flat surface.

pen-based computing

	[589]
	interacting with computers using a pen, as opposed to a
	keyboard or mouse. A pen allows fluid handwriting, gestures,
	and sketching that are difficult with many other input
	devices, thus enabling a more expressive form of input.
	Pen-based interfaces are popular in PDAs because of the
	portability and convenience of a pen. Stroke recognition
	allows the computer to interpret handwriting and gestures in
	terms of text and commands.

model-view-controller

	[59]
	(MVC) an architecture for software that separates the
	underlying application (model) from the user interface
	display (view) and input (controller).

	MVC is generally implemented with callbacks - the underlying
	application registers with user interface widgets (in the
	view and controller) and gets called back by them when
	something changes in the interface that it must respond to.
	Complete separation of the model, view, and controller is not
	in principle entirely possible, since all of them must still
	contain code to communicate changes to each other. Similar in
	spirit to a later architecture known as abstraction-link-view
	(ALV).

stroke recognition

	[590]
	the conversion of pen strokes into text or computer commands.
	Thus, when someone enters handwriting, a computer can convert
	it to text. When they express certain gestures, it can be
	recognized as commands. For instance, a swiping gesture may
	be interpreted as a scroll command. A squiggle may be
	interpreted as deletion.

side-channel messaging

	[593]
	in multi-person conversations (such as meetings),
	side-channel communication is communication between a subset
	of those in the conversation that is done without disrupting
	the primary conversation. For instance, in a videoconference,
	side-channel messaging systems allow a person to send a text
	message to another person or open up a separate
	videoconference without being heard in the primary
	conference.

eye contact

	[594]
	in conversations, people are aware of when people are looking
	into their eyes or not, and they use eye contact to signal
	turn-taking and attentiveness. In conventional
	videoconferencing systems, the camera is spatially offset
	from the monitor for viewing other people, and thus, when
	directly looking at another person, it appears that you are
	looking slightly away from them. It's not clear how this may
	affect communication, because in most cases the
	conversational partner may be perfectly aware of the
	phenomenon and able to determine whether they are being
	looked at or not even without perfect eye contact. However,
	some monitors allow eye contact through the use of
	half-silvered mirrors, for instance, allowing the camera to
	be offset but still capture a direct angle.

	one manifestation. Damage occurs to soft body tissues, such
	as tendons and nerves. RSI can be avoided by using a good
	posture, varying tasks, and taking frequent breaks to stretch

	it maintains a consistency that helps a user orient and
	remember the structure of the software.

	it informs the user about the context and the values espoused
	by the application and its developers.

	it helps a user remember and identify a specific product and
	vendor.

	it establishes a creative aspect to the design that cannot be

speech impairment

	[602]
	difficulty in spoken language, whether through vocalization
	or articulation impairments or through neurological language
	disorders. Computers can facilitate communication for people
	with speech difficulties. The field of study examining this
	is called AAC -- Augmentative and Alternative Communication.

	Aphasias (language disorders) may be aided in a variety of
	ways depending on the nature of the disorder. In extreme
	cases, a person with an aphasia may find it impossible to
	communicate sentences in any amount of time or in any medium,
	and in those cases, choice systems may help them communicate
	a limited set of ideas without syntax.

	When motor impairments are the source of speech difficulties,
	assistive devices allow a person to use non-vocal means to
	specify a phrase and may provide speech synthesis as output.
	Keyboards may be sufficient devices for some, but when motor
	impairment is more broad, some people may be able to enter
	single keystrokes only very slowly. A chart-retrieval system
	allows a person to enter an entire message by selecting it
	from a set of choices presented in a chart. Letter and
	message prediction systems anticipate the most likely next
	letter, word, or phrase that someone will wish to enter and
	make those easier to access.

	look-and-feel is considered the front end of the software,
	whereas the abstract functionality is the back end. The

	copyrightable aspects of the user interface -- those aspects
	not entirely determined by the functional requirements.

	brightness values for red, green, and blue elements. While
	theoretically equivalent to other color models (HSV, HSB,

constraint

	[61]
	a declarative specification of relationships between
	variables. These relationships are automatically maintained
	by the system. Among other applications, constraints are used
	in graphics systems to specify layout, e.g. by specifying
	that two objects should always be connected with a line or
	aligned along the same axis.

	A "one-way constraint maintenance system" allows the
	specification of relationships between variables, such that a
	variable B can be triggered to update whenever a variable A
	updates, but a relationship from B to A cannot exist. That
	is, cycles are not allowed. A one-way constraint maintenance
	system is not significantly different from an active value
	system, except perhaps syntactically.

	A "two-way constraint maintenance system" allows cycles and
	prevents them from infinitely cycling by either stopping
	after one pass through the cycle, waiting for the system to
	settle to a stable state (ending propagation when a value
	does not change more than a given threshold), or through
	slightly more sophisticated techniques.

	A "constraint solver" does not propagate changes, but instead
	solves for the next state of the entire system by solving
	systems of equations. Constraint solvers are limited to
	mathematical systems that are well enough understood to be
	easily solved, i.e. linear equations.

active value

	[62]
	a programming language extension that allows functions to be
	called every time a variable (the active value) is changed.

	Along with callbacks and constraint systems, active values
	belong to a family of techniques that are extremely helpful
	in programming user interfaces to maintain consistency
	between data and their graphical representation.

	Unlike callbacks, active values are a mechanism integrated
	into the programming language, so that programming using
	active values has simpler syntax and does not require
	explicit maintenance of the list of functions triggered.
	Unlike constraint systems, the triggering of an active value
	will always call the associated functions and won't resolve
	cycles. For instance, if a function associated with variable
	A changes the value of variable B, and a function associated
	with B changes the value of A, then the active value system
	will cycle forever (unless the program includes explicit
	checks for cycles).

bit depth

	[620]
	the number of bits used to represent the color of an
	individual pixel on a computer screen. A bit depth of 1 would
	represent that the pixel could only be on-off -- a
	black-and-white display. 8-bit displays can display 256
	colors. 16, 24, and 32-bit displays are also common and
	display thousands or millions of colors.

keyboard focus

	[621]
	the area or widget on the screen that is currently responsive
	to keyboard input. The keyboard focus is usually hilited in
	some way, for instance, with a focus ring around a default
	button, or the color or details of an active window. The
	keyboard focus can often be moved solely from the keyboard,
	often by tabbing between elements in a dialog box.

	With respect to windows, the window that currently receives
	keyboard input is usually the frontmost window, but some
	systems make whichever window the mouse is in the window that
	receives keyboard input.

drag and drop

	[623]
	a direct manipulation capability that allows you to select

typeahead

	[628]
	a feature for allowing users to continue typing without
	waiting for the computer to catch up. For instance, a word
	processor may not display every keystroke as it's entered
	because of difficult screen formatting, but will catch up as
	soon as the user takes a break. A user may start a search
	command, and instead of waiting for the search dialog to come
	up, the user starts typing the search term and hits Return --
	then, the search can begin even without bringing up the
	search dialog.

	[629]
	a view that automatically closes after a brief delay, thus

sense of presence

	[632]
	the degree to which people feel that they are co-located with
	the others they are interacting with despite the fact that
	they are communicating over a distance using technology. The
	sense of presence might be enhanced, for instance, by: more
	senses involved in the interaction, higher-bandwidth and

	environment, by handling such items as system purchasing and
	installation, software configuration, network configuration,
	backups, server maintenance, security, troubleshooting, user
	training, maintaining system stability, and providing
	technical support for users.

	System administrators are an important class of users for
	designers to consider. They are generally technically-savvy,
	but are often infrequent users of any particular software,
	called in to handle one-shot support activities (such as
	installation) or extreme problems (such as recovering lost

resource bundle

	[634]
	the portion of a piece of software that holds application
	data (but not user data) separate from the program itself.
	Typical resources include icons, window positions, dialog box
	definitions, program text, and menus. The resource bundle is
	a convenient way to modify and update various aspects of the
	user interface without having to recompile the software. In
	particular, by putting all text used in the program into the
	resource bundle, it becomes enormously easier to translate
	the software into another language.

keyboard echo

	[635]
	the appearance of letters on the screen as someone types.
	While echoing what people type is the norm, in some
	situations it's not used. Nothing is displayed when users
	enter one-letter commands, whether they are menu shortcuts or
	navigation commands in a game. Also, when entering a
	password, typically the letters are not shown for security

cut and paste

	[640]
	a simple device for users to move items/data into different
	parts of a document and between different documents and
	applications. A user selects an object and selects the "cut"
	command (from a menu or toolbar). This removes the object
	from its current position and places it into the system
	clipboard. (Alternatively, a user can "copy" the item to put
	it on the clipboard without removing it from its current
	location.) Then a user selects the destination for the item,
	chooses the "paste" command and the item is copied from the
	system clipboard to the new location (note that the clipboard
	still contains a version of the object).

	Some variations on cut and paste include:

	Drag and Drop: an alternative to cut and paste that allows a
	user to directly manipulate the object to move it from one
	place to another. Drag and drop is more intuitive because it
	doesn't involve the intermediate abstraction of a clipboard.
	However, drag and drop is inconvenient when the source and
	destination of the object can't easily be on the screen at
	the same time.

	Paste Swap: allows the item on the clipboard to be swapped
	with the currently-selected item, which is dramatically more
	convenient for situations in which two items need to be
	swapped with each other. With cut and paste, a temporary
	space must be used to store one of the items.

	Paste Format: allows the format of one item to be applied to
	another without replacing the item.

	View Clipboard: allows users to visually see what items are
	currently on the clipboard.

clipboard

	[641]

screen scraping

	[642]
	converting a character-based user interface to a graphical
	user interface by capturing the output of a character-based
	system and doing a surface-level transformation into the GUI.
	This is a simpler approach to upgrading a legacy system than
	reimplementing it, but has the obvious limitation of not
	providing an interaction style that is tuned to take
	advantage of the GUI.

	Screen-scraping may sometimes refer to the casual
	substitution of one design style for another without
	rewriting the application.

	In the context of groupware, screen-scraping refers to
	sending out the screen of one user to others without
	customizing the output for each user. This allows multiple
	users to share information for collaboration, but without
	much control. Input in such systems is handled by sending in
	input from whichever user has control at any given time, or
	by combining inputs.

usability death spiral

	[644]
	the condition where the longer a programmer or designer

	it appears to be.

	This is a metaphor to the aviation "Death Spiral" where the
	longer a pilot spends in a turn (in conditions where they
	cannot judge the horizon), the more likely they are to forget
	they are in a turn, fail to apply enough power to the turn

	functional prototype of the final website without the
	graphical components and often with only sketchy text content
	(e.g. "Product description goes here."). It is often
	accompanied by a tree diagram or flowchart of the website.
	The wireframe does not address visual design or page layout.

semantic net analysis

	[646]
	a method for understanding the structure of a domain by
	diagramming the relationships between objects in the domain
	and attributes of those objects. The information for creating
	a semantic net is usually obtained by interviewing users and
	domain experts. The diagram (the semantic net) is used to
	create a conceptual overview of the subject domain and is
	used to ensure a clear structure, consistency, and
	completeness in the overall application design. Objects in
	the diagram are connected by arrows labeled by relationships.
	Typical relationships include IS-A, HAS-A, CAN-BE, and
	CAN-HAVE, though any type of relationship may be used when
	helpful.

	focus groups to evaluate how engaging, attractive, and
	persuasive different options will be. The goal is to decide
	whether a design distinguishes itself, whether it captures
	people's attention, whether it is effective in getting them
	involved in the application, and whether it is successful at
	encouraging people to return to the interface to use it

	at which tasks can be performed.

	(computer error) a situation in which the computer cannot
	proceed through the normal or expected course of a task
	because of a bug in the software, an incorrect piece of code
	that doesn't properly handle unexpected inputs or performs
	its calculations incorrectly. In this situation, a system
	typically produces an error message for the user, and the
	program may either fail or enter an error-recovery process to
	enable to continue working despite an individual failed task.

multimodal interaction

	[658]
	interacting with a computer using more than one input or
	output channel at a time, usually suggesting drastically
	different input channels being used simultaneously, such as
	voice input combined with a mouse. The simplest, most common
	form of multimodal interaction with a computer is the
	simultaneous use of a mouse and keyboard. Driving a car is
	also an example where foot pedals are combined with a
	steering wheel and other knobs, levers, and buttons as input,
	while output is through windows, mirrors, warning lights,
	sounds, and the tactile feel of the road.

speech act

	[659]
	a view of language that treats communication as a series of
	actions in the form of speech, where each action is intended
	to cause some change in the world outside the speaker,
	whether it be:

	by causing a direct physical response ("I order you to put
	that down.")

	by compelling someone to make a spoken response ("Do you know
	what time it is?")

	by changing the social environment ("I now pronounce you
	husband and wife.")

	by affecting someone's emotional state ("You did a great
	job"), or

	by affecting someone's current state of knowledge ("Helena is
	the capitol of Montana.").

	In this view, every interaction is composed of a set of
	actions, many of which have built-in implications for what
	set of actions is appropriate as a response. Some groupware
	systems have attempted to build this view of interaction into
	communication interfaces by categorizing individual
	utterances (or messages) to constrain the possible types of
	responses and thereby facilitate faster and more error-free
	communication.

affordance

	[66]
	a situation where an object's sensory characteristics
	intuitively imply its functionality and use.

	A button, by being slightly raised above an otherwise flat
	surface, suggests the idea of pushing it. A lever, by being
	an appropriate size for grasping, suggests pulling it. A
	blinking red light and buzzer suggests a problem and demands
	attention. A chair, by its size, its curvature, its balance,
	and its position, suggests sitting on it.

	An affordance is a desirable property of a user interface -
	software which naturally leads people to take the correct
	steps to accomplish their goals.

	where multiple people may be interacting during its use, such
	as customer service applications (cash registers,
	telemarketing) and groupware. Each person in the evaluation
	team acts the part of a user or other person involved in a
	dialog with the user, and they step through primary tasks for
	which the user interface is intended. As with other
	walkthrough techniques, the goal is to identify difficulties
	with the tasks and ways to improve the interface, and the
	evaluation team ideally consists of a variety of stakeholders
	in the design (designers, programmers, users, etc).

stimulus-response compatibility

	[67]
	the degree to which what people perceive is consistent with
	the actions they need to take.

	Saying "red" when you see a red light go on is an example of
	high compatibility. Having to say "green" when a red light
	goes on is an example of low compatibility.

	Common examples in user interfaces are:

	in ordered lists (such as email ordered by date), the lists
	may be listed from top to bottom, but the Next arrow may be
	pointing to the right. If you click on the right arrow, do
	you select the item above the current item or below it? This
	can be especially confusing if the items are ordered with the
	most recent email (the last one) at the top. A more
	compatible arrangement would be to have up and down arrows,
	which always move the selection up or down, regardless of the
	order of the list.

	when a range of cells is selected in a spreadsheet, clicking
	on the down arrow at the bottom of a row will take you to the
	top of the next row. Sometime this is what people have
	intended. Sometimes not.

documentation

	[670]
	manuals, help systems, and other materials used to introduce
	and explain a system to users. Manuals and readme files
	typically contain installation information. Manuals and help
	systems typically contain both reference information and
	how-to information (tutorials or "task-based" help
	information that guide users through step-by-step
	instructions on specific tasks).

	A common approach, called "minimalist documentation",
	emphasizes the need for direct, concise, and simple language,
	and careful focus on the most important information to help
	users in their tasks.

man page

	[671]
	a help system provided on Unix and Linux systems. A user

readme file

	[672]
	a file often included with a software release called "README"

	compatibility, and other product documentation that was too
	last-minute to make it into the printed documentation.

customer support

	[673]
	sometimes "tech support"; assistance provided to a user after
	the purchase of software to solve problems with the product,
	such as bugs, installation problems, data recovery, usability
	problems, and so forth. This support is often available
	through a hot line, bulletin board, or mailing list. Customer
	support can be a significant cost to the software
	manufacturer that is significantly affected by the usability
	of the product.

	Customer support is help provided to a customer (a user) to
	help resolve difficulties in using a system, usually in the
	form of a human answering questions over the phone. Customer
	support personnel can provide substantially more relevant and
	useful help to a user than a help system can, but a common
	problem is being confused about the state of the computer the
	user is using, so various ways to communicate the current
	system state and error codes to customer support help them to
	isolate problems.

	Improving the usability of an application will usually reduce
	the use of customer support and thus save customer support
	costs (except where customer support is a profit center, in
	which case, the incentive is to decrease usability, but this
	is obviously a nasty cycle you don’t want to get into).

	Some customer support can be provided automatically to reduce
	costs, such as including help within the application,
	providing support information on your website, or using
	automated telephone-answering systems and fax-back services
	to provide relevant help.

help desk

	[674]
	an organization providing user support for computer and

	usability difficulties, software bugs, system administration,
	version and compatibility concerns, and so forth. Help desk
	software assists people at the help desk in retrieving
	answers and entering frequently-asked questions. Sometimes
	called a "call center", "tech support center", "computer
	support center", and various other permutations of
	"computer", "customer", "help", "IT", "technical",
	"resource", "support", and "center". Help desks measure their
	performance by the number of calls they take, the average
	number of calls kept waiting, the average length of calls,
	and their ability to resolve the user's problems.

	database. The individual points can be represented as simple
	shapes and colors, but may also contain complex figures and
	labels depending on the complexity of the records they
	represent and the degree of detail the user desires.
	Interactive capabilities permit a user to manipulate the
	starfield to select subsets of points, review individual

	applied to text editing, a version of cut and paste that
	simplifies selection and saves keystrokes. When a word is
	selected and cut from a sentence, instead of leaving spaces
	on either side of the word, one of the spaces is deleted so
	that the sentence remains with proper spacing. When a word is
	pasted into a sentence, a single space is guaranteed on both
	the left and right of the word, rather than having the word
	appear directly next to another word and forcing the user to

human anthropometry

	[684]
	anthropometrics; the measurement of the physical
	characteristics of humans, particularly length and weight
	measures, used for industrial design, especially the design
	of furniture, vehicles, and workspaces. In the domain of
	computer use, such measurements apply primarily in the design
	of input and output devices, computer desks and chairs, and
	in the application of recommended working postures. The
	typical goal is to understand not just the average
	measurements of, for instance, arm length and joint rotation
	angles, but to understand the range of possible variation
	within the target user populations to adequately support the
	full range of users, from children to aging adults, and
	including both male and female dimensions.

biometrics

	[685]
	the detection and use of unique identifying physical
	characteristics in identifying users of a system, typically
	for security reasons to restrict access without the use of
	passwords. Examples of biometric devices include: thumbprint
	readers, retina scanners, body heat scanners, and
	typing-pattern detectors (using inter-keystroke delays).
	Biometrics can rarely be forged, but unless the biometric
	devices are secured to ensure that the person who is gaining
	access is the same person who is being scanned, it is
	certainly possible to copy the individual data to pose as
	another person.

touchpad

	[689]
	an input device used for moving the pointer on the screen,
	much like a mouse. A touchpad is like a small touch tablet
	that uses relative rather than absolute coordinates. They are

touch tablet

	[690]
	or drawing tablet; a large flat surface that a user can touch
	with a hand or a pen (or a puck) to control the position of
	the pointer on the screen. Touch tablets typically work in
	absolute coordinates, meaning that each point on the tablet
	maps to a specific point on the screen, rather than relative
	coordinates, which is common for a mouse and many other input
	devices. Absolute coordinates are important for applications
	requiring precision drawing or the copying of drawings, which
	can be accomplished by laying a drawing over the tablet and
	tracing it with a pen or puck.

CRT

	[691]
	cathode ray tube; the traditional technology used for

	categories: <Output Devices>

screen refresh rate

	[692]
	the frequency at which a monitor can update its display; in
	CRTs, the rate at which the electron beam repeats its pass
	over the entire screen to refresh the dimming phosphors. The
	refresh rate represents the maximum rate at which graphics on
	the screen can change. A slow refresh rate will appear
	unnatural. Computer monitors often have a refresh rate of
	about 100 Hz (the display refreshes 100 times per second),
	whereas an NTSC television has a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
	However, televisions interlace their display, which is to
	say, they alternately update the even lines and the odd lines
	of the display on each pass to improve the speed of the
	refresh, but only effectively update the entire display 30
	times per second.

flat screen display

	[693]
	or flat panel display (FPD); a screen that is very thin,
	potentially using a variety of different technologies, such
	as LCDs and gas-plasma displays. In contrast, because of the
	need to direct an electron beam across the whole display,
	CRTs can't cost-effectively be made smaller without
	sacrificing the quality of the display. Flat screen displays
	are frequently used in portables, hand-helds, and pen-based
	devices.

	Passive-matrix displays are LCD displays where each pixel is
	controlled by activating an LCD element at the specific
	position on a wire grid. Active-matrix displays include a
	transistor at each grid point, permitting a design that
	generally provides a faster refresh rate but at a higher
	cost.

raster display

	[694]
	the standard technology for computer monitors that display
	images on a grid of pixels, allowing the computer to light up
	any individual pixel easily, and enabling color displays by
	having individual red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphors at
	each pixel point. In contrast to a vector display, raster
	displays can often require much more memory for a simple
	image and do not draw smooth diagonal lines, because all
	lines must be composed of a series of individual dots on a
	grid, creating an effect called aliasing.

	categories: <Computer Graphics> <Output Devices>

vector display

	[695]
	a technology used for computer monitors that moved the
	electron beam in a CRT directly along the paths between
	specified points on the display, creating very sharp, smooth
	lines and requiring very little memory to refresh the
	display. Vector displays are mostly obsolete but were
	especially common for oscilloscopes and other scientific
	instruments and in older arcade games. They've been displaced
	by raster displays, which allow much more flexible images.
	Color is not possible in a vector display, though sometimes
	it is partially simulated by tinting regions of the monitor
	to give regions where images were colored differently.

touchscreen

	[696]
	a screen that has a touch-sensitive film over it, allowing a
	user to touch areas of the screen to move the pointer and
	press buttons, thus allowing a very direct interaction with
	an image. Touchscreens are most commonly used in public
	kiosks because of their simplicity and the reduction of
	components that can break down or be lost.

	or "target platform"; the technical parameters of the
	system(s) that a piece of software is being developed for,
	which impacts how many users will be able to use the software
	as well as the difficulty with which a user can put together
	the necessary hardware platform and operating system
	environment. Some of the common platform parameters include:

	CPU: instruction set, speed

	available memory: RAM, hard disk space, removable media

	operating system: including version and options, such as

	electronics (TVs, VCRs, stereos), toys, computers, and
	appliances. Industrial design focuses on the physical form
	and interactive properties as opposed to the electronic
	functioning of the system. In computer design, in addition to
	a concern for appearance and ergonomic form, industrial
	designers are concerned with such things as how the computer
	is manufactured and assembled, how heat is dissipated, how
	robust the system is during transportation, and how much

	than 3 clicks. Applying this principle can be tricky because
	of the ill-defined nature of what constitutes a primary
	feature or logical step (what level of granularity is
	relevant to making this design), but it nevertheless is a
	helpful rule of thumb in trying to minimize the steps
	necessary to perform tasks. However, religious adherence to

experiment

	[709]
	an empirical study designed to relate cause and effect by
	ruling out as many alternative causes as possible and by
	actually manipulating the cause to obtain the effect, as
	opposed to merely finding a correlation between the two that
	may not be due to causation.

	Experiments come in many forms, but a prototypical example is
	to try to determine if some change will result in an
	improvement. For instance, if I add a certain button to my
	word processor, will people be able to write their documents
	faster. In this example you would have an "experimental
	condition", using the word processor with the button added,
	and a "control condition", using the word processor without
	the button. The "independent variable" is the factor you are
	manipulating, whether or not the button is present. The
	"dependent variable" is what you are measuring to determine
	the effect, in this case, the amount of time to produce the
	same document with each version of the word processor.

	typical user profile might explore, for instance, how much
	experience users have with computing or a particular piece of
	software, what type of physical limitations they have, how
	frequently they perform common tasks, or what education or
	reading level they might have.

design for evolution

	[711]
	or plan for obsolescence; organizations and computer systems
	are always in flux, so it is rare that a design can be made
	in a one-shot fashion without being terribly expensive to fix
	when the environment around it outgrows it. Therefore, as
	much as possible, designers need to try to anticipate future
	trends in order to create designs which will work in a
	variety of settings or which are straightforward to modify to
	fit new situations. Expect change.

design for manufacture

	[712]
	a term from industrial design that emphasizes the importance
	of making tradeoffs so that designs are actually practical to
	manufacture at reasonable costs, in a reasonable amount of
	time, given the resources, personnel, and tools available.
	User interface designers need to have an understanding of the
	software development environments that will be used and what
	their strengths and limitations are. They also need to be
	sensitive to the workforce and scheduling limitations that
	the development team must work under.

prototype-instance model

	[713]
	(programming) a version of object-oriented programming that
	does not have classes. Instead, objects inherit behavior
	directly from other objects. This dramatically simplifies the
	language by removing unnecessary concepts such as
	metaclasses. This approach was popularized by the "Self"
	language.

	(psychology) a theory of how people organize concepts. A
	concept is assumed to be defined by a prototype, so that,
	when a person thinks of birds in general, a prototypical bird
	comes to mind, let's say a sparrow. Then when deciding
	whether anything else is a bird, they compare how similar it
	is to their prototype. Thus, an ostrich still seems like a
	bird, but much less like a bird than a robin, which is very
	similar to a sparrow.

favorites list

	[714]
	any shortcut designed to help users mark their favorite items
	and then revisit/reuse those items quickly, such as the use
	of bookmark lists to mark favorite web pages or lists of
	favorite files in file dialogs. Favorites lists are similar
	in spirit to lists of frequently or recently used items to
	help provide shortcuts to users, except that unlike frequent
	and recent lists, favorites lists require explicit action by
	the user to create and maintain the list.

waterfall model

	[718]
	a traditional linear model of the software development
	process that suggests each phase of development could be
	completed independently and pass its results onto the next
	phase. Thus, a requirements phase would produce a
	requirements document that would then be used as input to a
	system architecture phase. This traditional approach has been
	widely criticized and various approaches stressing a more
	iterative development process have been preferred. The
	central problem is the need for feedback from later stages in
	development to inform earlier stages, such as the
	requirements phase. This is often achieved through
	successively refining prototypes toward the final system and
	updating the requirements and design as a better
	understanding is developed.

mythical man-month

	[719]
	a man-month is a way of measuring work output for production
	which is reasonably helpful in certain limited areas of
	industries like manufacturing. The basic idea is that if you
	want to produce twice as many sprockets, then you can hire
	twice as many people to get it done. Worker productivity is
	measured by how much one person can do in one month. Thus,
	what takes 1 person 100 months to perform should take 100
	people 1 month to perform.

	This perspective is called "mythical" because it doesn't
	apply in many organizational settings, and in particular in
	software development environments. Doubling the people on a
	software development project may not merely fail to double
	the speed of development, it may actually slow a project
	down.

	[72]
	a set of methods for getting ideas from your competition,

	conventions, or finding usability problems that can be fixed.

	Results of a competitive analysis can be used in marketing,

virtual toolkit

	[720]
	a cross-platform user-interface toolkit. With a virtual
	toolkit, the user interface is developed with a layer of
	abstraction in calling up widgets and dialogs. The virtual

symbol segmentation

	[722]
	automatically identifying the boundaries of individual
	meaningful units within a continuous input stream, such as a
	computer identifying individual words within spoken speech or
	identifying individual letters in handwriting. In simple
	circumstances, such as slowly and distinctly pronounced
	speech or careful non-cursive writing, the boundaries between
	symbols are relatively easy to identify, but typical speech
	blurs the boundaries between words and adjacent words
	influence how they are pronounced. Similarly, in rapid or
	cursive writing, it isn't as clear what letter and individual
	stroke may be contributing to.

usage study

	[725]
	as opposed to usability testing, which typically brings
	people into a lab to examine specific usability questions
	against often predetermined benchmarks, a usage study
	examines how a system is actually being used in its actual
	work setting, which may entail discovering that it is being
	applied to unexpected problems and in unexpected
	circumstances and also provides a sense of how the work
	context affects usability issues.

chauffeured prototype

	[726]
	a prototype, typically done as a paper-and-pencil version of
	the interface, that the designer walks through with the user
	and manually demonstrates how the interface would respond to
	user actions. For example, the user might say "I'd click this
	button", and the designer would pull out a dialog box on
	paper that would appear. The advantage of a chauffeured
	prototype is that not all pieces need to be assembled but
	interactivity can still be tested; the designer can
	spontaneously create any missing pieces based on what the
	user needs in any given scenario.

observation room

	[727]
	during usability testing, the observation room is a separate
	room from which experimenters can observe the user without
	disturbing the user, often observing through a video
	connection or through a one-way mirror. The observation is
	almost always explicit -- the user is perfectly aware of
	being observed. In most cases it would be unethical not to
	tell the user about being observed, and most users are able
	to guess it anyway. Nevertheless, by being separated from the
	user, it helps the experimenter to avoid commenting or
	otherwise interacting with the user, and helps lower the
	user's anxiety and produce more naturalistic behavior.

spamdexing

	[728]
	efforts to fool search engines into providing a high
	relevance ranking for the pages of a website, even when the
	website may not be an appropriate match for a given keyword.
	This is undesirable because it interferes with users attempts
	to find appropriate sites. Tricks for spamdexing include
	submitting hundreds of pages with slightly different keywords
	to a search engine, using false keywords, repeating keywords
	to appear to be a good match for the keyword, and doing
	almost any other manipulation of source documents to ideally

subpane

	[733]
	or just "pane"; a window may be divided into multiple
	subpanes, each of which is typically devoted to different
	pieced of information. Subpanes are typically fixed in
	position with respect to the window as a whole. From a user's
	view, the subpane may not be specifically identified as such,
	and may only be obvious in cases such as split windows, where
	the user can actually create and resize panes. From the
	programmer's view, the subpane provides an independent
	drawing area that clips to its boundary, allowing the
	programmer to treat it independently from other subpanes,
	much as if it was its own window.

line-oriented interface

	[738]
	A user interface based on a user editing individual lines of
	text at a time, especially with regard to early text editors.
	In such systems, instead of moving around in the document as
	in screen-oriented editors or graphical user interfaces, the
	user could enter commands to list out lines within a document
	or could specify a line to edit. The user could edit an
	individual line by inserting and removing characters and
	moving the cursor left and right. While this level of
	interaction seems quite primitive, it was largely dictated by
	the constraints of the technology (some line editors used
	line printers as the output device, rather than CRTs) and by
	the speed of interaction with shared computers.

question-asking protocol

	[739]
	in contrast to the think aloud protocol, in which users are

	from the tester, in the question-asking protocol, the tester
	explicitly asks the user questions during the user testing
	session, to see how the screens are being interpreted and to

GUI

	[74]
	graphical user interface, pronounced "GOOEY". A user
	interface that presents information graphically, typically
	with draggable windows, buttons, and icons, as opposed to a
	textual user interface, where information is presented on a
	text-based screen and commands are all typed.

	It's often assumed that GUI applications are inherently more
	usable than text interfaces, but that may not be true when
	GUI applications are not well-designed. Graphics enable more
	flexibility in design and enable certain useful interaction
	styles (like direct manipulation), but text-based
	applications may still be extremely usable if they are
	designed through a user-centered process: gathering
	information from users, carefully designing the interaction
	tasks, conducting user testing, etc.

self-report

	[740]
	any method of gathering usability data through having the
	user report what happened. This may be by having users record
	themselves on tape or writing down in diaries. They may range
	from open-ended reflections to very specific questionnaires
	that users fill out during their use of the system. Users may
	report on all use of software or only critical incidents,
	such as major problems in accomplishing their tasks.

journaled session

	keystrokes and mouseclicks, are automatically recorded into
	logs or journals. This data can later be analyzed to
	determine a user's pattern of behavior, find trouble spots,
	examine learning times, and corroborate observations in other
	media. This approach may help in automating the analysis of

formal usability methods

	[742]
	methods to specify user interfaces, where "formal" means that

	interface from a specification, or to guarantee that certain

sprite

	[744]
	an operating system capability that allows programmers to
	easily create independent graphical objects ("sprites") that
	can move around the screen. A sprite automatically handles
	redrawing areas of the screen that it crosses over, saving
	the programmer from worrying about updating all the other
	graphical elements that it crosses, much like a window
	manager helps a programmer to develop within a window without
	worrying about other window updates. Sprites are used for
	animation, especially in games, but can also be helpful for
	providing drag-and-drop style interfaces.

interlacing

	[745]
	displaying images by drawing only a partial image first,
	consisting of alternate lines, or every 3rd or 4th line, then
	filling in the remaining lines progressively. When images are
	displayed slowly, such as large gifs slowly downloading off
	the internet, this permits a useful preview of the image as
	it arrives. Interlacing is also used in the NTSC broadcast
	television standard to give the impression of a faster screen
	refresh rate -- every 60th of a second, alternate lines (even
	or odd) are updated on the screen. Thus, the full screen is
	updated only every 30th of a second, but the impression is of
	faster refresh.

convention

	[746]
	a systematic approach to design that is established through
	consistent usage within a design community. Conventions are
	de facto standards, established not by the dictate of
	authority, but through implicit agreement and imitation.

	Some common conventions include:

	placing website navigation buttons along the left edge of the
	web page

	drawing tools and their appearance in 2-D drawing
	applications, such as the selection rectangle, pencil, magic
	wand, paintbrush, and shape tools

	Conventions often get built into standards once standards are
	created. For instance, the Command-A key combination used for
	the Select All menu command was originally established by
	convention but later became integrated into user interface
	standards.

standard

	[747]
	or "norm"; a rule for how user interfaces should be designed
	for given tasks, users, and contexts. User interface
	standards are usually encoded in style guides and are
	available for every major operating system. Standards help to
	ensure consistency across applications for users, thus
	reducing learning time and helping to prevent user errors.

	Some common standards include:

	which menu items exist and how they're named, e.g. the Edit
	menu should contain Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste

	what the appearance of user interface widgets should be,
	including the color, size, and shading of them, and how they
	respond to user input

	how text should be selected and modified

	what style icons should appear in and how to differentiate
	files from applications

multi-dimensional scaling

	[748]
	MDS; a statistical technique useful for understanding the
	structure of a domain, especially useful in early stages of
	design. People are asked to rate pairs of concepts for their
	similarity, then these similarities are fed into the
	statistical algorithm to determine dimensions that
	effectively describe these patterns of similarities.
	Essentially, the idea is to determine a space in which each
	concept can be mapped so that similar items are close and
	dissimilar items are far away. The MDS algorithm seeks to
	find the fewest dimension in which such a space is possible.

	As an example, consider an application for choosing baby
	names where you want people to be able to find an appropriate
	name as quickly as possible. You would ask potential users
	(expecting parents, for instance) to rate the similarities of
	large numbers of names, e.g. "On a scale of 1 (very similar)
	to 7 (very dissimilar), how would you rate the names John and
	Sarah?" After getting a large number of ratings, the MDS
	algorithm would then determine the dimensions that best
	describe the data. The algorithm won't name those dimensions
	for you, but will simply specify a number of dimensions and
	where each name falls along each dimension. So for instance,
	you may find a dimension in which Joe, Bob, and Tom all fall
	at one end while Jenny, Amy, and Susan all fall at the other
	end. In this case, you would be likely to identify the
	dimension as gender. In the example of names, you might also
	find dimensions of nationality and pronunciation. Thus, your
	interface for selecting names may allow the users to select
	gender, nationality, and sounds to help them find an
	appropriate name, or you may allow the user to ask for
	"similar" names once they have found one they basically like.

transition effects

	visual effects that animate the transition from one visual
	display to another, used especially in presentations and
	video. Effects include fade in and out, pan (left, right, up,
	and down), zoom in and out, checkerboard patterns, and wipes.
	Transition effects help make the change more salient and less
	abrupt. Each type of effect can be used to set a mood, a
	pace, and even imply metaphors for how the displays are being
	navigated.

	performing the operation of a single click, but applied to a
	broader range or in a more general fashion. The most common
	use is in desktop interfaces where a double click on an icon
	means to open the associated document or application.

spoken language interface

	[754]
	a user interface where the user can, at a minimum, issue
	spoken commands, and optimally, conduct all interaction with
	the computer via speech. Speech systems are differentiated
	by:

	how restrictive they are in what style of speech they can
	recognize, e.g. do they handle dialects or non-native
	speakers well?

	whether they recognize only the speech of an individual (who
	must train the system) or are general-purpose in
	understanding a wide class of people

	whether they can recognize continuous speech or require that
	each word be carefully and distinctly spoken

	the range of their vocabulary, i.e. speech recognition is
	much more reliable when only 10 words must be differentiated

	Spoken language interfaces are very appropriate for many
	phone interfaces, but they don't work well in noisy
	environments (e.g. with the television on) or in environments
	that must remain quiet (e.g. libraries and many work
	settings).

natural language interface

	[755]
	a user interface that allows people to interact using a human
	language, such as English, as opposed to a computer language,
	command line interface, or graphical user interface. Natural
	language interfaces may be designed for understanding either
	written or spoken text. Typical approaches have been
	attempting to replace command lines and database queries with
	natural language queries or trying to use natural language
	syntax for programming languages (e.g. two simple attempts
	were Cobol and HyperTalk).

	The most common problem is ambiguity -- users actually
	frequently prefer the consistency and clarity of computer
	languages to the unpredictable results of a natural language
	command, which may have multiple interpretations. The other
	fundamental problem with achieving full natural language
	understanding is that understanding language often means

pointing device

	[756]
	any device used to indicate a position, as a mouse is used to
	point to a position on a screen. Typical pointing devices
	include a mouse, pen, lightpen, trackball, touchscreen, touch
	tablet, touchpad, and possible a joystick or cursor keys. In
	3D, various pointing devices include the 3D mouse or bat and
	the dataglove.

claims analysis

	[757]
	analyzing the relationship of design parameters to the
	usability of an interface. A claim is a statement that a
	certain aspect of a design, such as the location of a button,
	the interactive style of a scrollbar, or the feedback given
	in response to a user command, has certain psychological
	implications that are reflected in how capable a user is in
	using that design. In claims analysis, artifacts of the user
	interface are listed along with their design features and all
	relevant positive and negative implications of each design
	feature are listed. This approach can help to select among
	alternative designs, and clarifies the questions to be
	analyzed through user testing by stating how the design
	should work as a set of well-defined claims.

requirements analysis

	[758]
	an early phase in user interface design where basic
	requirements are determined. Typical | of requirements
	include target audience and target platform, features of the
	application, responsiveness, usability benchmarks (e.g. "such
	and such a task must be completed within 2 minutes"), and the
	choice of general look and feel guidelines. Requirements are
	usually established through a combination of analysis and
	gathering information from target users, through interviews,
	observation, focus groups, and surveys.

status line

	[759]
	a region on the screen, often at the base of a window, with
	general status information about the computer as a whole or
	the specific window or application. Typical information in
	status bars include:

	date and time

	current location of the cursor in a text document

	current page being viewed

	connection status in internet applications

	which of several views is currently displayed in the window

cursor

	[76]
	an indicator that marks the location of the text insertion
	point, usually a thin vertical blinking line or a small caret
	(upward-pointing triangle) at the base of the line of text.

	Note: "cursor" is often mistakenly used to refer to the
	pointer, the small arrow moved by the user to select areas on

automatic scrolling

	[760]
	scrolling that occurs when a user drags outside the visible

isometric joystick

	[762]
	a joystick that doesn't move when pressure is applied to it;
	the isometric joystick is sensitive to the force a person is
	applying. When used to control a pointer, as when embedded in
	the keyboards of many laptops, the isometric joystick
	controls the velocity of pointer movement. A major drawback
	of the isometric joystick is that it doesn't provide any
	kinesthetic feedback to the user. In other words, the only
	non-visual feedback users get is the pressure they feel in
	contacting the joystick, but not in any motion.

joystick

	[763]
	an input device that consists of a user holding a stick in
	their hand, where movement of the stick from its central
	position provides both a direction and a quantity that can be
	used to control pointer movement or other types of
	interfaces, such as aircraft control. Joysticks tend to be
	better for specifying relative movement as opposed to
	aligning a pointer to an absolute position or tracing paths.
	A variant, the isometric joystick, doesn't move, but instead
	responds to the force applied to it.

doorway page

	[764]
	(or gateway page) a page designed as an entranceway to a
	website. The most common doorway is a homepage, but a doorway
	page can be a useful alternative entrance that appeals to a
	specific target audience. An example is to use a doorway as
	the page people go to after clicking a banner ad, that
	addresses their specific concerns more accurately than the
	homepage would. A doorway page can also be submitted to
	search engines to encourage multiple routes into a website
	that suit different interests. However, this is sometimes
	abused, in the case of spamdexing, when pages are made with
	specific keyword combinations that suit a particular search
	engine but without providing an appropriate result for that
	keyword search.

seizure disorder

	[765]
	in some types of epilepsy, a seizure can result from the
	presentation of a rapidly-varying stimulus, such as flashing
	lights and repetitive sounds. Thus, interfaces should avoid
	strobe effects, blinking effects, and repetitive noises. In
	most interfaces, these are likely to annoy almost any user,
	but in the instances when such effects may be appropriate or
	useful to the target users, a warning should be provided,
	along with a way to disable the feature. The exact conditions
	that trigger seizure may vary, so it's even better to provide
	ways to disable all repeating audio or animation or to
	control the speed of the animations.

kinesthetic feedback

	[766]
	knowledge people have about the position and movement of
	their bodies based on nerves in their joints and muscles
	(also known as proprioception). Such feedback may play a role
	in hand-eye coordination, the use of input devices, and
	reaction to output devices that cause the body to move.

mouse

	[767]
	an input device used to control the position of a pointer on
	the screen by detecting relative movement of the device. The
	typical design uses a ball in the bottom of the mouse that
	rolls as the mouse is moved along a surface, and detectors
	translate this movement into horizontal and vertical vectors
	that are translated to the machine to specify movement of the
	pointer. Many implementations will also move the pointer a
	greater distance when the mouse is moved more quickly.

	Both "mice" and "mouses" are acceptable as the plural of
	"mouse", though "mice" appears to be far more common.

Gantt chart

	[768]
	a diagram used in project management, where the x axis is
	time and the y axis shows tasks to be performed to complete
	the project. Each task is displayed as a horizontal bar
	spanning the time period during which it is expected to take
	place. Arrows may be drawn from one task to another to
	indicate dependencies (when one task can't be begun until
	another is completed). The Gantt chart was developed by
	Charles Gantt in 1917.

	a node and connected to other tasks with arrows to indicate
	task dependencies. Each node may be labeled with necessary
	resources for the task and start and finish dates. Nodes are
	usually laid out chronologically from left to right, with
	tasks done in parallel drawn one above the other. PERT charts

sensory modality

	[772]
	A communication channel associated with one of the human
	senses of sound, vision, touch, smell or taste. As used in
	discussing usability this may imply input to and output from
	the computer as well as the human user. E.g., the sound
	modality may be used both for output from the computer and as
	input (in the form of voice recognition software).

scrollbar

	[78]
	(or scroll bar) a control for moving the view of an area that
	is too large to be entirely visible in its display region.
	Vertical scrollbars (shown below) move the data up and down,
	and horizontal scrollbars move the data left and right within
	the view.

	"Scroll arrows" cause the view to be shifted incrementally in
	one direction at a time. A "scrollbox" (also called a "thumb"
	or "elevator") allows the user to move to a specific region.
	"End boxes" are buttons at either end of a scrollbar that
	allow a user to scroll immediately to the beginning or end
	(they don't appear in most GUI standards).

breadcrumbs

	[786]
	on websites, a form of navigation where the current location
	within the website is indicated by a list of pages above this
	page in the hierarchy, up to the main page. For example, if
	you were browsing the products at a department store, you
	might see the following hierarchy when you're on the Sneakers
	page:

	Home -- Products -- Clothes -- Shoes -- Sneakers

	Each of the | above the current page is usually a link to the
	corresponding category page.

	The term "breadcrumbs" is a reference to the Hansel and
	Gretel tale where they leave breadcrumbs as they wander the
	forest so they can find their way home. The metaphor is
	imperfect because the breadcrumbs do not represent the actual
	path the user took, but instead the optimal path from the
	home page to the current page in the hierarchy.

perceptual user interface

	[788]
	PUI; a user interface that maximizes the bandwidth of
	communication between a user and a computer, using multimedia
	to capitalize on all the user’s senses, and using multiple
	input modalities. This enables a user experience that is more
	like the way that people interact with the real world, taking

splash page

	[79]
	or splash screen; a website homepage that is used for
	emotional impact and has very little navigation or
	information. Instead, it typically just displays a large and
	stunning graphic or a simple typographic message to intrigue
	the viewer and lure them into the website.

	In practice, it's rarely a good idea, since it wastes
	precious download time for the user, it obscures by not
	including critical information about the website, and it
	delays the time that a person actually enters and starts
	using the website, increasing the probability that you've
	exceeded the user's patience or attention span and they've
	left for another site before they even figured out what yours
	was. Splash pages open up numerous opportunities for poor
	design such that users can't find their way into a website.

	Frequent problems include:

	not including clear navigation or a clear means of entering
	into the website - many users will not discover that they can
	click on the image to enter if the image doesn't clearly say
	so.

	providing no clear options to users who do not load images.

	requiring the use of plug-ins or browser features that are
	not backward-compatible, so that many users are excluded
	because of the capabilities of their machines or the type of
	browser they've chosen to use.

virtual value chain analysis

	[791]
	a "virtual value chain" is a business model for the
	information services industry, developed by John Sviokla. The
	value chain starts with the Content provider, then goes to
	the Information Infrastructure for distribution and
	transactional support, and then to the Context provider
	supplying user interfaces and customer interactions
	(Content-Infrastructure-Context-Customer). It contrasts with
	a "physical value chain" of manufacturing-distribution-sales
	for traditional product companies.

	An analysis of the virtual value chain examines what role a
	particular company plays within this chain, and if they are
	not currently providing information-based (e.g.
	internet-based) services, how they can transition to the
	information-based business model. Really, the virtual value
	chain merely provides a conceptual framework in which you'll
	do a more traditional business-process-reengineering (BPR)
	analysis.

ROI

	[792]
	return on investment. A measure of the value of making an
	investment. Spending money on information systems
	development, and on usability in particular, means providing
	a rationale for how the project will be managed to achieve
	maximum return, i.e. providing a cost justification for the
	work.

feedback

	[793]
	a reaction to a behavior that has the potential to influence
	the original behavior. In other words, when a user does
	something, the computer responds so that the user has some
	understanding of how the computer interpreted the user's
	action. When the user moves the mouse, the pointer moves on
	the screen. When the user types, the keys click. When the
	user selects an icon, it hilites. When the user selects a
	menu item, it flashes and some action takes place.

	Without responsive and relevant feedback, users question
	whether their actions have been recognized and understood
	correctly.

exit tunnel

	[795]
	a sequence of screens the user views when they leave a
	website (or any media presentation), parallel to the use of
	an entry tunnel to enter a website, but much harder to
	enforce on the web than an entry tunnel. The exit tunnel
	enables the designer to impose a message on the user,
	enabling the main points of the website to be reinforced for
	the user. Exit tunnels are not a recommended approach even
	where they can be enforced, such as CDROM presentations,
	because they force the user thru an undesirable path without
	the consent of the user.

moderator

	[796]
	a person who plays a gatekeeper role in group interactions.
	The moderator controls who has the floor and what messages
	and artifacts are shared with the group. The moderator may
	control who can enter into the group conversation (e.g. who
	can enter a chat room) or kick someone out who's not
	cooperating. The moderator may be a facilitator of the
	meeting (helping to lead and coordinate in other ways) or may
	not. The moderator sometimes is restricted from participating
	in a meeting in ways other group members are allowed (e.g.
	the moderator may not be allowed to participate in votes).

content blueprint

	[797]
	a specification for the content that will be needed in
	creating a website or multimedia presentation. The blueprint
	specifies every page or screen and what components are needed
	for each. A typical way to specify the necessary elements is
	to supply a screen layout with each item labeled (the screen
	layout doesn’t have to be final, but merely indicative of the
	content elements and the constraints on them, such as size
	and relationship to other elements). The list of pages
	usually comes directly from a site architecture. This, in
	combination with a style guide (specifying the look of
	graphic elements, such as fonts and colors, and the writing
	style), provides the primary information needed by content
	developers. They then create all of the detailed information
	in the form of a script.

device independence

	[798]
	the ability for software to work with a variety of different
	input or output devices without having to worry about which
	ones exactly the user is using. This enables users, such as
	the disabled, to use whatever devices are most appropriate
	for them. This has enabled users to switch between, for
	instance, a mouse, a trackball, or a touch tablet, each of
	which works best in different situations. When done well,
	people with motor disabilities can substitute joysticks,
	large keyboards, blow-suck tubes, or whatever they like.

	and may come in large numbers. Complaints are categorized and
	prioritized (in a kind of triage system) so that major bugs
	are addressed rapidly. Trends in complaints help identify
	system weaknesses or usability problems. In a perfect world,
	a design is tested with users long before it is used in the
	field, so complaints should be rare, but even fully tested
	sites may have problems that are either non-obvious in a lab

kerning

	[853]
	the amount of spacing between adjacent letters of type. It's
	not sufficient to have letters equally spaced in order for
	them to look equally spaced. In a word like "balloon", the
	letter pair "ll" must be further apart than the letter pair
	"oo" in order to appear evenly spaced. Letters should be
	adjusted by a principle of "optical spacing", looking at how
	much whitespace is created between each letter pair and
	adjusting to make that amount of whitespace even throughout a
	word.

	Most computer fonts have built-in kerning rules so that
	kerning rarely needs to be done by hand, but it may still be
	necessary for small fonts, unusually wide or tight spacing,
	or for logos and headlines where minor spacing problems will
	be more apparent. In very tight spacing, some letters may
	overlap, and this may require adjusting the individual
	letterforms to create a desirable appearance. Sometimes a
	principle called TNT, tight-no-touching, is used when
	tightening up words to move letters as close as possible
	without letters touching, but this will often result in poor
	optical spacing.

adaptive palette

	[891]
	a tool palette or toolbar that allows tools to be selected
	from a pop-up menu, and then shows the chosen tool as the
	default tool for that menu (can be selected again just by
	clicking, without the menu appearing). This enables the user
	to access the most common tools quickly, under the assumption
	that the most recently-selected tool is the most likely tool
	to be needed. However, this doesn't work well when a person
	needs to alternate between tools within a single pop-up menu.

publish-subscribe model

	[893]
	a mechanism for sharing data between applications and for
	workgroup collaboration. Applications can "publish" their
	data to a file, which will automatically notify all documents
	that have "subscribed" to that file, and those documents then
	update to reflect the most recently published data.

	A simple example is to use a spreadsheet to track monthly
	weather patterns. Each month, the spreadsheet is used to
	publish a graph of that month's activity. A monthly
	newsletter subscribes to the file and thus automatically
	pulls in the graph when the newsletter is edited.

working set

	[894]
	a small number of resources that a user switches between
	frequently, such as files users frequently edit or drawing
	tools they rapidly alternate between. The working set is
	identified so that the interface can support moving quickly
	between items in the current set while more slowly accessing
	less common items.

	A bookmark list is an example of supporting frequency, but a
	working set is meant to emphasize optimizing your current
	task with only a small set of items, say, 2 to 6. The Windows
	taskbar is an example of giving the user easy access to a
	small number of current tasks, but doesn't continue to
	support it well when your number of open files is large.

spring-loaded mode

	[895]
	also called a user-maintained mode or quasimode. A mode that
	must be actively maintained by the user, such as the use of

	interpreted as capital letters while the shift key is
	actively held down by the user.

search

	[908]
	the mechanism that enables users to find things in large
	information spaces. Search issues fall into 3 common |: how
	people specify their search queries, what determines a
	"relevant" match, and how search results are displayed.

	query syntax:

	typical options for specifying a search query include boolean
	expressions, natural language queries, parametric search,
	refining previous queries, scoped search, similarity requests
	("find documents like this one"), and the typical web query
	style (keyword with quotes to identify multi-word strings and
	+ and - to indicate required or excluded terms).

	relevance:

	what determines a good match for a query is a major subject
	of research. Algorithms rely on frequency of keywords, order,
	prominence, expert indexing, and popularity of a result for a
	given keyword. Advanced search engines often consider these
	types of capabilities -- spell-checking, synonym substitution
	(if they look for 'jobs' they might also want 'careers'),
	stop words (the term 'web' doesn't usefully distinguish web
	pages, so ignore it), fuzzy queries (allow non-exact
	matches), and stem words (if they asked for 'biking' also
	look for 'bike').

	displaying results:

	some issues in displaying results include how to rank
	results, how to group results (by category, domain name,
	etc.) and visualize relationships between them, how to
	display results within a structured document, what
	information to show about each match, and how many matches to
	display. Since most searches result in too many or too few
	results, the interface needs to provide useful search tips
	suggesting how to reformulate queries for improved results.

TreeMap

	[91]
	a diagram for representing hierarchical structures (trees). A
	TreeMap displays the hierarchy as a series of embedded boxes,
	where each box contains its children, usually by alternating
	at each level between laying them out vertically and laying
	them out horizontally.

	The relative size of each box can be made proportional to
	some property where the parent's property is the sum of the
	children. For instance, in a hierarchical file system, file
	size can be represented by the size of the leaf nodes, and
	each folder or directory is the size that is the sum of the
	size of the files within it.

coaching method

	[911]
	an approach to usability testing that involves a user and an
	expert coach. Instead of disallowing questions, users are
	encouraged to ask questions of the coach, who responds with
	appropriate instruction. By hearing typical user questions,
	problems are identified and help documentation can be
	designed. In addition, since users learn more quickly,
	relatively expert performance can be studied.

	details can't be made out, the user can see the overall
	structure of the information. Also, structuring information
	spatially provides a more intuitive approach to navigation

boolean search

	[920]
	a search that allows the user to enter logical expressions
	including AND, OR, and NOT. This is a common advanced search
	feature because of its ability to specify desired results
	very precisely. However, in natural language, "and" is
	frequently used as a logical OR, and "or" is often, but not
	always, used as a logical EXCLUSIVE-OR. Users make this

	natural language rather than a special search syntax. For
	instance: "What shipments have been received in the past 5
	days from the west coast with a total value of $10,000 or
	more?" Natural language queries are rarely optimal because
	novices don't get what they expect when they use ambiguous
	queries and experts can usually specify a search more
	accurately and efficiently with a special-purpose syntax.

	3 bedrooms and 2 baths.

noun-verb paradigm

	[936]
	an approach to specifying commands to the computer, also
	called the select-then-operate paradigm. First an object or
	objects (representing some data -- the nouns) are selected.
	Then an operation (or commands -- the verb) is selected to
	perform some action on the objects.

	The alternative, the verb-noun paradigm, is the approach
	taken most often by command-line systems. The verb-noun
	approach corresponds to English commands: "Delete this file."
	It also better supports multiple arguments to the command.

	The common rationale for noun-verb interaction is that it
	removes modes -- if you select an object, you can easily
	deselect, change, or extend the selection, whereas with
	verb-noun, you choose a verb and the system is left stuck
	waiting for a noun, in a mode. Of course, this is ridiculous
	since the verb can obviously be changed or deselected just
	like a noun and the modality problem can occur in both
	directions.

	In the end, noun-verb dialogues are more appropriate when
	many operations are needed for a single object , and
	verb-noun dialogues are best when multiple objects need a
	similar operation performed.

surrogate users

	Typical surrogates would include managers, union reps,
	coworkers, friends, and designers (especially those who have
	interacted w/ users). Surrogates are used when actual users
	are hard to find, difficult to work with, or otherwise
	unavailable.

	Surrogates can provide information in 3 ways:

	by reporting on what they know about the user, which can be
	limited by lack of knowledge or bias

	by role-playing how the user would behave, which runs the
	risk of stereotyping the user's behavior

	by simply being themselves (and relying on their relative
	similarity to the user as an approximation of the actual user
	data), which avoids stereotyping but may fail to account for
	known differences between the surrogate and the user.

	clinical setting, from hospitals to home care.

	Applications may include entering orders and scheduling
	medications and other treatments, retrieving information from
	other hospital computing systems (lab, pharmacy, admissions,
	etc.), providing decision-making support to physicians, and
	even helping hospitals track the success of care for

controlled vocabulary system

	[961]
	any interface that is limited to the use of a small

	refers to natural language and spoken language systems that,
	in order to produce consistent, predictable results, limit
	the number of recognized words.

	A controlled vocabulary is also a design approach that
	provides a styleguide with a list of prescribed terminology
	to ensure consistency in vocabulary and usage in your content

internal validity

	[971]
	the degree to which the design of a study allows you to
	accurately attribute an observation to a specific cause
	rather than alternative causes. An undesirable alternative
	cause for your result is known as a "confound".

	An example is to compare the amount of time it takes in using
	2 alternative interface designs. You would like to claim that
	if one design is faster than another, then the time
	difference is due solely to differences in the interfaces. An
	example of a confound is when different groups of people are
	tested for each design--if one group is more skilled than
	another, that would be an alternative explanation for the
	observed time difference.

	A "control variable" is a potential confound that has been
	controlled for so that it can reasonably be ruled out as a
	possible explanation. For instance, to avoid the above
	confound, subjects can be a control variable by assigning
	them randomly to each test condition.

external validity

	[972]
	the degree to which the results of a study can safely be
	generalized to apply to settings and parameters outside those
	of the original study, such as to other populations, times,
	places, similar tasks, and other measurement instruments.

	related: {ecological validity}

	categories: <Empirical Methods> <Empirical Methods>

construct validity

	[973]
	the degree to which the testing tool and measurement tool
	used in a study accurately reflect the conceptual question of
	interest. For instance, asking people whether they feel that
	a product is usable is not necessarily an accurate measure of
	how effectively they can use it.

	categories: <Empirical Methods> <Empirical Methods>

statistical validity

	[974]
	the degree to which an observed result, such as a difference
	between 2 measurements, can be relied upon and not attributed
	to random error in sampling and measurement.

	The degree of statistical significance of a result depends
	upon the number of sampled data points (e.g. the number of
	users in a test), the size of the effect, and the amount of
	variation between measurements. Thus, statistical validity
	can be improved with increased samples, by reducing noise
	(and thus variation), and by creating as large an effect as
	possible.

	categories: <Empirical Methods> <Empirical Methods>

confound

	[975]
	any factor that might serve as an alternative (and generally
	undesirable) explanation for a result seen in a study, such
	as non-randomized samples, practice and history effects, and
	any arbitrary differences between things that are being
	compared.

	[981]
	the tendency for people to blame themselves rather than

learned helplessness

	[982]
	when a person has repeated experiences of failure at a task
	or skill and learns to assume that they aren't capable, when
	in fact they may simply need to be taught from a different
	point of view or to break the problem down into smaller,
	achievable subcomponents. In user interface design, this
	problem is encountered when someone is overwhelmed by complex
	interfaces, and a simplified interface or improved training
	procedure is called for.
