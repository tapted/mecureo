This is to inform you that as of today the first official Beta of my
HTML widget is publically available. It is distributed under the Library
GNU Public License.

Main site:

You can get it at the following sites:

ftp://ftp.nerdnet.nl/pub/X11/Widgets/XmHTML.

Here's a short overview

- builtin image support for X11 bitmaps, X11 pixmaps, GIF87a,
  GIF89a, JPEG and PNG;
- handles PNG gamma correction, all color types and depths,
  and fully supports tRNS chunk, bKGD chunk and alpha channel
  processing.
- GIF images are decoded using a patent free scheme;
- builtin support for animated GIF89a and animated GIF89a with
  NETSCAPE2.0 loop extension. XmHTML supports all GIF89a disposal
  methods;
- image support covers all X11 visual types and display depths;
- delayed image loading;
- progressive image loading of XBM, single image GIF and baseline
  and interlaced JPEG;
- powerfull HTML parser with extensive document verification and
  repair capabilities;
- builtin scrolling interface (both keyboard and mouse);
- anchors can be displayed as pushbuttons;
- anchors can be highlighted for enhanced visual feedback;
- autosizing;
- capable of displaying text/html, text/plain and standalone
  images;
- supports the full HTML 3.2 standard; as well as the
  HTML 4.0 <FRAMESET> tags;
- an extensive set of callback resources;
- text outlining;
- smart and user-definable font mapping;
- can work with a predefined palette (which it can even
  create for you);
- builtin quantizer using Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion;
- four different dithering methods allow one to achieve an
  optimum balance between performance and image quality;
- fully compatible with LessTif;
- comes with an extensive set of documentation (html-manual
  pages, Programmers and Reference Guide and a collection of
  examples);

The most important item that is still missing and is very high on my
priority list is support for HTML tables. The current codebase already
carries some provisions for tables. I expect to release a second Beta
with table support within two months.

As a final note: although XmHTML is a Motif widget, porting it to other
toolkits should be relatively easy.

Enjoy,
Koen D'Hondt
