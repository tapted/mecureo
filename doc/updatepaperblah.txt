Word truly is posessed by a devil of some description.

I think I managed an exorcism of sorts. In any case,
the file size is much smaller, and the references and
images are stable.

Pictures are all in. The only change was a paragraph
in Section 4.1 (the last para) hinting at the better
way of doing things with NLP that is being trialled,
and some minor gramatical errors fixed up.

The current link is:

One FOLDOC parameter-permutation managed to get done
it's hooked up by selecting

"Matched with NLP Link Detection"

on the intermediate page.

I haven't had time to test it yet.

Keywords are still being extended. They currently
stand at 187.

The case-matched parse is staring at me while
thrashing away on definition number 12156 [I
think it's 3LA]; so I'll prolly have to cancel
it before I head off.

Also I think I may come in on Monday next week
if that's okay as Tuesday is Honours orientation.

Thanks,
	Trent.
