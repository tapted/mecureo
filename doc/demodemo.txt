Andrew mentioned that a good query, with good categorised relationships
was desired.

I ran the NLP Parser/ontology generator on my home machine last night
for three [of the 6] levels of link detection for FOLDOC and I'm quite
pleased with the results [if not the runtime :)]

There is an excellent sample query [actually the 'old' default, done
better] that can be demoed [MECUREO + VLUM].

The steps are:

start at

http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~tapted/mecureo/modelgrow.html

Check 
"Try and open in VLUM" [should check Output RDF as well with js] and
change the '30' in 'distance to grow' to '300' [this becomes the
number of nodes].

The next page has some new defaults: case-matched NLP, Node Number.
These should already be checked, along with SQL and declarative
language. All you need to do is click Generate Model.

The model should then open up in VLUM, with FOLDOC on the right frame.

The direct URL is:

http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~tapted/mecureo/rdfvlum.cgi?ontology=fdg%2Ffcasetag.fdg&w1.1=%22SQL%22&w2.1=%22declarative+language%22&distance=300.0&peerage=0&mode=num&Submit=Generate+Model

It is clearest if the Depth Limit slider is set to 1.

For me, Netscape automatically 'clicked' SQL, but internet explorer
sometimes did not [selecting Filter -> None, even though it is
already checked, will expand SQL (clicking SQL might not)].

Leaving SQL selected, a filter can be chosen: child, parent, sibling
and synonym all produce meaningful, accurate and interesting results.
In fact, I feel the need to say that it is still fully automatic -
the ontology is unmodified after coming out of the parser.

Selecting 'declarative language' [also left-aligned as it is a
direct query node] can give an example of an 'antonym'
relationship [imperative language].

The definition for SQL is long and detailed, and so performs better
than declarative language [whose definition is more brief] when
it comes to link classification.

A final note about loading times: MECUREO is now quite fast - the
ontologies are gzipped, which saves slightly on IO, and a faster
CPU is rsh-ed into to run the query. However, Netscape tends to
load things quite slowly still. IE 5.5 with JDK 1.4.1 took me less
than 10 seconds to load everything after VLUM was cached, whereas
Netscape took about 36 seconds [inside Madsen].
