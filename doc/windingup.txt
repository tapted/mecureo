My apologies for the last email - strange things happened when
I tried to paste the link. I'll try again:

All the javadocs have been updated, and contain the more detailed
technical information. They are here:

http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~tapted/mecureo/doc/api-docs/index.html

There are a few gaps that I will fill in time.

I've adjusted the parsing flags so that "unkown" links will remain
"unknown" in VLUM, rather than being grouped with explicit siblings.

I'll need to re-parse the dictionaries for this to take effect though.
In idle-time over the next week or so I'll get some closure on the
keywords mapping and do a final parse. Trawling for unclassified
links, determining a likely 'sense' and checking changed classifications
is kinda time-consuming and a little arduous.

The nlpwriteup has been updated with more information, and included
is the current keywords mapping and stoplist. It is still here:

http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~tapted/mecureo/papers/nlpwriteup.doc

I've also written in a workaround so that the concept map graphs
can be viewed in VLUM (previously RDF would not be output if
all the _nodes_ had a weight of 0, as they do for concept-map-
generated graphs).

Also, should I leave a printout of the experiment instructions
somewhere?

The final comparison should probably be done with the query result
based on the complete/final keywords file.. although deciding
whether to use stem-matching is still an issue. Ultimately, the
links in the case- or otherwise-matched ontology will be a subset
of those in the stem-matched ontology (apart from links detected
that have a stronger relationship and hence override a weaker,
relationship detected at a lower level).
