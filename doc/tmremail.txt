Sorry, I need to dash [see prev. email].

But I thought I'd just check to see if I'm on track with where you
most prefer me to be, or if I should change the priorities:

- Strict Concept Mapping write-up
- Expanding keywords for NLP
- Fixing broken journal paper [reformatting, adding link detection
    and other writeups]
- NLP Writeup
- Anything else?

I also discovered another freely availably NLP library called
"GATE" - I've not yet investigated the license, although grok
seems to be performing adequately for now, so I don't think I'll
go through the hassle of learning and incorporating it.
